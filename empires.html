		 <h2>Ariandor</h2>
				 <h3>Dragondale</h3>
<p>The city of Dragondale is ran by a council of merchants. It is the only city in the realm where are all welcome, and trade is denied to none. Only those who have sought to make themselves and enemy of the city through threat of war, or breaking of treaties or laws would ever be denied by them. They take pride in their impartiality, never choosing a side or taking part in any wars that might occur in the realm. So long as chaos and troubles do not ;spill into their territory, no one has anything to fear from them. Due to ;their, open door policy, Dragondale is the largest empire in the realm in ;both trade and military standing, having an elite force that ensures peace ;is kept and no trades or routes are interfered with.</p>
			  <h3>Bahkal Forest</h3>
<p>			 The Bahkal Forests is inhabited and looked after by the Garians that reside within it. Being a tribe rather than a city, they are not as trusting of outsiders as most. It is said that the Garian's are one of the seven tribes of the Bhamori, barbarians like those of their kinsman and known to be the protectors, the watchers, and keepers of the seven tribes many secrets. They have no real use for coin and are completely self sustaining, requiring little more than food, herbs, and clothing to survive. Those who have been successful in bartering with them, have reported that they have a penchant for herbs that can not be found within their own forests, and for weapons, armor, or ore that would enable them to make their own. The Garians are ruled by the iron hand of Khan Yarrock, a warrior who is highly respected and revered among their people.
</p>				 <h3>Phelan</h3> <p>Outside, the walls of Phelan look dark and bleak. Made of stone from its mountain mines, the walls are thick and stout. But the view from the inside is spectacular. white and black marble with gold veins cover the walls, and painted cobblestones line the streets. Since the city was taken over by its current Magister, the city has prospered under his rule as an open city. Anyone can become a citizen of Phelan, as long as they obey the law. Although vampires still make up a large number of citizens, they are by no means in the majority. Trade flourishes, taking advantage of the unusually large supplies of minerals and precious stones available in the mountains, as well as the vast forests surrounding Phelan for lumber.</p>
				 <h3>Wulfruden</h3> <p>A great mystery surrounds those of Wulfruden, so much so that none but their kinsman know where they live. It is rumored that they are one of the seven tribes of the Bhamori. They are a tribe who chooses to stay hidden from the realm, offering sanctuary to those select few who come to their Khan for aid. A highly spiritual tribe who holds great reverence to the 'Great mother.' Those few unsuspecting travels who have managed to somehow stumble upon their home, have never been heard from again.<br /></p>
				 
<h2>Agragon</h2>


	<h3>Akahram</h3><p>Having been pushed from their greener homelands in Balmorral territories during the time of the great cleansing, the kingdom of Akahram now resides in the desert lands of Agragon. Well known followers of Death, they pay the god tribute and homage, for Death is inevitable for all things. Those of the Wulfruden and Akahramans having lived as one for a time, until war, not only with Balmorral but themselves divided the two. Fearing their own extinction they followed their Priest who led them to where the city is now. They are not overtly friendly with the outside world, and are highly secretive. No lycans who are shifted into their were forms are permitted entrance, and any who shift within are arrested on the spot, the wrath of Balmorral always within their thoughts and fears. Trade with them is hard to achieve, as is an alliance, but not impossible, so long as one follows their laws and shows them the respect they feel they deserve.</p>
	<h3>Balmorral</h3><p>Balmorral rules over most of Agragon and is a kingdom of holy zealots that is not only ruled by their King, but by the church that governs their lives. Believing themselves to be the Holy Cleansers whose one mission in life is to rid the realm of ALL evil. They do not accept outside trade with any, and will use whatever means necessary to strike the blight of the unholy from the realm. The undead are instantly slaughtered, those who practice witchery, arrested and tried. Demons, lycans, are given no quarter, animals given humanistic form seen as unclean. Only those full humans who bow to their one god would be given any respect, though even then, small. Entrance into their city must be gained through invitation or approval and trespass will be met with arrest. They are, the elite force in the realm, that even the largest and most powerful of empires give a wide berth to, never wanting to give reason for the Holy Zealots to cast their light upon them.</p>
	<h3>Dur'Amon</h3><p>Dur'Amon can be found in the upper north portion of Agragon within the cold damp regions. The village of giants are a robust, yet friendly type yet they are all governed by their own suspicions and fear of their neighbor, Balmorral. This fear leads them to prevent anyone that might be deemed unholy by Balmorral from entering their village. They do welcome outside trade with others, though it is difficult if one is not a giant, human or elf. Most seek them for their ships, that are said to be the best in the realm. These well made vessels are able to withstand attacks at sea better than all others.</p>

<h2>Azure</h2>

<p>
	<h3>Dream City</h3>Located on Azure in the Jungle of the Mori within it's mountain peaks, Dream City keeps to itself for the most part, staying out of the bickering's of both man and god alike. They are open to both visitors and trade, though seek items of a magical nature. Recent housing development aiding in the influx of their population. <br /></p>

<h2>Elzeothis</h2>

<p>
	<h3>Bhamori</h3>The Gathering place for all seven tribes, Bahmori is considered sacred and holy, no battles maybe fought other than in contest, and all who enter must leave their hostilities behind. A permanent encampment where one can come to trade and barter for goods, livestock, slaves and wives. During times of festival a great fire is lit where members from tribes gather and share stories of their adventures, telling of those who have fallen and the battles fought, of honor won and lost. The Bhamori strive to live lives worthy of honor and respect, avoiding that which would bring shame to themselves, or the tribe. Punishment for crimes committed within the tribe can vary from having to defend your honor in the circle of challenges, to being shorn, to death. There is only one law, and that is to live with honor, always. 
	<h3>Felwithia</h3>It has always been set exactly where it currently exists in Elzeothis. Originally when it was first known as C&aacute;llamb&euml;a, ruled by The Snow Elven family of Sigeneneweth. The residents were strictly and only of the snow-elven race. The lands outside the Kingdom ruled by the Dragon Ashnivac, the Kingdom has always paid tribute to him, in the form of a statue at the entrance as well as offerings to him, though that is only known to the Royal Family, as to what the offerings may be. Open to trade and boasting a port with fleet of ships that one might pause in wonder and awe at the beauty of them. </p>

<h2>Ethica</h2>

<p>
	<h3>Baeladar</h3>A beautiful land of forests, fields, enchanting river valleys and southern chain of nearly impassible mountains all of which support a rich and abundant wildlife. High Elves rule this land with a mix of their much less numerous gray and woodelf cousins from their stunning capital made of crystal. Perhaps the oldest known empire that pre- dates even the Dhurzarians, they consider themselves superior to all other races and act accordingly. Preferring land over sea, the high elves currently have virtually no navy to speak of aside from a few warships and merchant vessels. Perhaps this with the persistent rumors of some ages old dispute has led to the estrangement between them and their Sylvan cousins in Marenwae, though the exact reason is unknown or been forgotten in the sands of time. While alienated with Marenwae, there is outright hatred and warfare between Baeladar and Malahgar whenever the two meet. Claiming to be one of the original elven kingdoms in the realm, Baeledar was formed after a war between their kinsmen erupted, sending one side into the forests of Ethica, the other, far underground to form the kingdom of Malaghar within the Underdark on Nersa. Having been isolated for many years after the great quake divided the lands into what they are now, they have recently been discovered again. A prideful people, rather snobbish and aloof, though none are able to fault their craftsmanship and skill in matters of art or literature. They are open to trade, though are more inclined toward the elven population than any other, save for the drow, who are still regarded as their enemy and arrested on sight should one ever pass through their gates.
	<h3>Dhurza</h3>A broad far reaching land ruled by the Dhurzarian Empire spanning the mountains, plains and plateaus north to Ethica, fertile lands to the west adjoining the and bordering the inland sea. Stretching back into antiquity, this ancient kingdom was founded and still ruled by Draconians. Though resource poor, conquests through the ages have allowed the Dhurzarians to acquire vast wealth, especially gold. Many of their warriors even adorning themselves in gold armor and jewelry. Such is their love for the soft yellow metal that they are often referred to as 'The Golden Empire". Their power has waned in the last few centuries as new empires have arisen to challenge them, most notably the Valurians with whom they have been in almost constant warfare. Though their powerful navy and large army are still forces to be reckoned with, the recent alliance forged between Valuria and Akahram has alarmed them greatly. Added to this slow decline is the falling back from their northern territories due to increasing raids by the Balmorral zealots of Avangar.
	<h3>Kildonan</h3>A mountainous land of mystery, wild and untamed, covered in thick enchanted forests which surround deep lochs and firths. Little is known of this area as the fierce and reclusive dwarvish clans which inhabit it are none to friendly to outsiders. The highland clans are renown for their finely crafted armor and weapons but trade with only a select few merchants to the envy of others in that profession. They lack an interest to get involved in the wars and skirmishes of others. Usually choosing to look after their own. If it doesn't effect them or their own, they want no part of it.<br /></p>

<h2>Frawg Isles</h2>

<p>
	<h3>Nar'Got</h3>The empire of Nar'Got was first built on Thathoth as a dual faith city between Kasimir and Furina. It's rulers, Iilvarra and Leilah, worked together for many long years to establish it as one of the largest trade cities in the realm. It is no longer a dual faith city, once belonging to Kasimir alone after the betrayal of the high priestess of Furina. Having been rebuilt on an Island among the clusters of those found in the black sea. It is still one of the largest trade cities in the realm, being rivaled only by Dragondale. They have sense cut all ties with Kasimir when their new leader came out against their sister empire, Valuria. Having taken part in several wars over the years, and being the only empire to have faced Balmorral and survived. Nar'Got has ports on every continent and several islands throughout Tirradyn, they also have an immense army, possibly the largest in the realm to protect the city, as well as trade routes and ports, be they land, sea, or air. Save Dragondale, Nar'Got is the empire that all other empires seek to gain an alliance and trade with in order to help their own empire grow and gain standing in the realm. </p>

<h2>Hikaru</h2>

<p>
	<h3>Chyndagh</h3>The Chyndagh Empire is comprised of several groups of peoples found along the northeastern region of the Hikarian continent. What started out as a loose alliance of fisheries, plantations and mines that united together in order to combat rampant piracy and slavery, has solidified into a major power in Hikaru. Chyndagh city itself is located along the cliffs of Phoenix cove. Steep mountains with a narrow pass and a secluded harbor have made the city easily defensible with a small force, allowing for rapid expansion and uniting the people in the region, establishing itself as a nation to be reckoned with.</p>

<h2>Nersa</h2>

<p>
	<h3>Palantal</h3>Palantal city is divided into several districts The centre contains buildings such as shops and hostelries that are recognizably urban. This is surrounded by rings of glades, where the elven and faerie population live above the ground within the trees. Docks occupy stretches along the river and watchful defenders ring about the city. The temples and guilds have their place away to the west, while the northern side of the city is graced by the castle and gardens where the ruling family dwell. There were once a series of forest kingdoms and elven dynasties across Nersa. Rivalries between them led to each king or queen going their own way, dividing the power and strength of the high elven people. Although the kingdoms never went to war with one another, the divisions contributed to the fall of several at the hands of their drow cousins, the decline of other smaller provinces. In cases, the site of an elven settlement was adopted and settled by humans, whose towns and cities are more numerous than the original occupants. Several faerie communities are scattered through the forest, within and beyond Palantal itself. These are usually only village-sized, but (with their typical whimsy) the rulers, usually matrons, are referred to as "faerie Queen" and each has a handful of ladies in waiting and dapper knights. Queen Dandelion-leaf, Queen Niamhe "the Nightingale" and Princess Thisbe are among these. Travelers sometimes stumble on such a court to be told its glory and tales, gifted with jewels andshining presents. Then wake, alone in the woods, their pockets full of acorns and their ears being used to grow mushrooms!
	<h3>Malaghar/Underdark</h3>Living in vast caverns connected by an extensive tunnel network, the Malahgarians carry out their various plots and schemes in a dark atmosphere of mystery, magic, suspicion and deception in a never ending dance for power. Little is truly known of the Malahgarians and even less of their activities except they are cruel, malicious, slavers, have contempt for every other race and an undying hatred of their fair cousins on the surface, especially the Baeladar. Only the brave, foolish, desperate or power seekers enter their tunnels and few of them ever return, least unchanged. 
	<h3>Village of Narina</h3>Having began as a small settlement of humans and grew, with increased population, interest in the boarding school and addition of the healing center, day care center and beautiful scenery. Narina now boasts a decent sized population, merchant shops and guilds, including the Merchant, Craft and Officer Guilds. </p>

<h2>Samadnar</h2>


<h3>Cormanthor Yastehanye</h3>
<p>The lands of Cormanthor Yastehanye were settled by a diverse grouping of young eight elves back when the old Gods existed and ruled the realm. Through time, it has evolved and become a mighty Empire for those that are shunned in other lands. All are welcome, though all may not leave with skin in tact, should their words or ways bring wrath. Trading and merchant alliances are typically formed with the individual merchants, unless it is of great importance to the Empire itself, then one may deal with a representative of the Emperor.</p>

<h3>Shadia</h3>
<p>The home of the secret of shadowforged weapons and armor, they are sought by many far and wide who seek their skill and knowledge in the acquisition of what some insist is the best armor and weapons in the realm when it comes to fighting beings of darkness. Due to their lack of resources and military might, they are highly covetous of their forging secrets. Willing to die before allowing the secret to pass their lips for it is the only way they are able to live in peace among the other empires, and thus ensuring that none would seek to disturb them for fear of losing their right to trade. They are ruled by a council of seven, who look after the well being of those who live in Shadia. They decide the acceptance or refusal of trade, and have no interest in the petty wars of others, choosing to remain neutral and uninvolved at all times. <br /></p>

<h2>Islands Across Tirradyn</h2>


	<h3>Ka'lephil</h3><p>A kingdom of silver elves, once ruled by King Mithos with his wife Queen Mwenidon until his demise has left her the sole ruler. They are a prosperous nation who openly seek trade with larger realms. Rumored that they had their sight set on conquering before the death of their King, their Queen assures that no such deeds or acts are planned for any nation save those who would announce themselves enemy to the throne. They boast a large military and naval force that aids in making sure that trade routes on both land and sea are not disrupted by pirates or bandits.</p>
	<h3>Marenwae</h3><p>A place of enchantment and wonder, one of the few, if not the only places in the realm that has been left untouched by modernization or war. What once lived in abundance over the realm now only exists here, and is the home of fairies and satyrs, wood nymphs and brownies. Animals move about in peaceful coexistence with one another, while the air is filled with laughter and song. Powerful magics surround this realm making it difficult to find though occasional barbarian raiders stumble upon it seldom to be seen again.
	<h3>Thelysia</h3>The last of the god Orma's angels, they have kept to themselves since his death. A place that is said to bring peace to even the most hardened of hearts, Thelysia is a village of wonders that are beyond the imaginings of the human mind. Opting to stay out of disputes, never choosing a side and not believing that there is such a thing as good or evil, those of Thelysia will offer to aid any and all who seek it, though only in the ways of healing, comfort, or education. A place that is completely self sustaining, they require little, if anything from the outside, though are sought after for their powerful poultices and salves, potions and pills of healing and resistances, that far surpasses any others that can be found in the realm.</p>
	<h3>Valuria</h3>
<p>Valuria is a thriving empire that has been known throughout the realm as the conquering empire. Having previously been ruled by those who kept their faces and names unknown, they spent hundreds of years conquering other lands and nations and attempt to gain foothold throughout the realm, showing no mercy and using whatever means necessary to win battles. They can be talked into trade, though usually using this as a means to learn about weaker nations. They may, or may not decide that what resources the approaching empire has would serve their needs, and if they peak their interest enough, will seek to conquer and place them under their rule. </p>
