<p>The ranger class is the base class for those characters that have an 
affinity to nature.  The ranger class itself has little magic to speak of, 
as those first beginning to commune with nature have not learned many of the 
powers that nature can provide, however this does not mean that this class 
is without its abilities.  Rangers are fairly decent fighters, falling 
between warriors and thieves in this respect, plus they receive combat 
bonuses when fighting in outdoor nature based sectors that make them nearly 
the equal of warriors in such situations.  Rangers also receive nature based 
skills such as building shelters and tree blinds, creating things from the 
natural surroundings, and the camouflage ability which renders a ranger 
entirely unseen except by those with special vision or other rangers of 
greater skill.  Rangers also learn the lore of herbs and plants, and are 
able to use them to mix a variety of beneficial remedies and concoctions 
that provide a host of benefits.  Rangers may use any weapon they wish, 
though longer weapons such as polearms will handicap them in close quarters. 
</p> 
<p>Rangers excel most with the spear and the sword, and receive several unique 
skills with the spear that no other classes can gain. Rangers can be of any 
alignment, though evil rangers don't idolize nature so much as they find it 
comforting or useful.  More often, evil rangers merely feel closer to nature 
because it provides them a safe sanctuary to hide in away from bustling 
cities full of guards, however this doesn't make them any less adept at the 
abilities afforded them through their connection to the natural world. </p>
