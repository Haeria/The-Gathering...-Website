<h1>Monk</h1>
<p>Monks are spiritual warriors who have devoted their energy to the 
  perfection, and balance, of mind, body, and spirit. To this end, the monks 
  undergo a rigorous training regimen. Instead of using mana as a source of 
  power, monks have turned inward, drawing upon the power of their spirit, to 
  harness a new energy they know as Chi. Monks focus upon Order and Chaos, 
  more than the sometimes subjective ideals of Good and Evil.  Though 
  unwilling to use weapons, depending solely on the purity and strength of the 
  body, their hands and feet become fearsome weapons of destruction, able to 
  deal out damage and death easily and sometimes with little effort.  They 
  have also achieved some little enlightenment, allowing them to use their chi 
  energy to overcome and strengthen what might be considered weaknesses of the 
  body. Monk prime stats are Strength and Dexterity.</p>
