<p>		Clerics are people that have chosen to follow the path of enlightenment
through a deity.  Their powers are derived directly from this deity
for most things, though purely physical skills aren't.  Clerics have
mid-level combat abilities, excelling most with bludgeoning based weapons
such as maces and flails.  The deity a cleric chooses to follow may be
either good or evil.  Neutral clerics exist, but in some areas their
powers are diminished from those that have chosen a side.</p>
 
<p>Clerics are the most defensively orientated of all the classes.  Most of 
their spells focus on healing or defending the faithful, with their few 
combat spells being far less powerful than those of mages. However, clerics 
are the best class by far at healing magics, and they possess an impressive 
array of protective magics, as well as fair combat prowess.</p>
 
<p>Since they worship and derive their powers from a deity, clerics have an
additional stat that other classes do not:  piety.  A cleric's piety will
increase through prayer, making sacrifices to their deity, and through
the use of their powers.  As their piety rises, so does the power of
their spells.  Piety will slowly decrease over time without prayer, usage,
and sacrifice.</p>
