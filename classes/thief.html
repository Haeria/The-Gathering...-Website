<article class="left_article">
  
  <p>			Thieves are a marginal class. They do few things better than any other 
class, but have the widest range of skills available.  Thieves are 
specialists at thievery and covert actions, being capable of entering areas 
undetected where more powerful adventurers would fear to tread.  They are 
better fighters than clerics, but lack the wide weapon selection of 
warriors.</p>

<p>All thieves begin with the dagger combat skill, and are learned in steal as 
well.  Any other weapon skills must be purchased, unless the default 
selection is chosen.  This default skill package includes:<br/>
<strong>backstab</strong> - the art of attacking from the shadows<br/>
<strong>dagger</strong> - the weapon of choice for thieves, ideal for backstabbing<br/>
<strong>dodge</strong> - avoid blows in combat<br/>
<strong>hide</strong> - the art of remaining undetected in a room<br/>
<strong>mace</strong> - the use of maces and other blunt weapons<br/>
<strong>peek</strong> - used to look into a person's belongings<br/>
<strong>dirt kicking</strong> - skill of trickery to blind your victim with dirt<br/>
<strong>sneak</strong>- move undetected from room to room<br/>
<strong>steal</strong> - any thief is adept in retrieving objects<br/>
<strong>pick lock</strong> - a useful skill for breaking and entering<br/>
<strong>disarm </strong> - used to deprive your opponent of his weapon<br/>
<strong>second attack</strong> - with training, the skilled thief can hit twice as fast </p>
