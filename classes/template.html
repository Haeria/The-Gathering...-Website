		<h2>Sekhym</h2>

<p>
The Sekhym Elves are an offshoot of the Sylvan Elves common to Tirradyn.  
They are not a new people to Tirradyn, but they are secretive.  Decades of 
negligence by the former Goddess of Magic led to them retreating into the 
deep, dark and wild places of Tirradyn, often eschewing large cities and the 
company of their elven cousins.  Despite being solitary, they are a friendly 
people, willing to go out of their way to help a stranger in need.  They are 
the self-proclaimed guardians of the leylines, the mortal lorekeepers of 
magic, rumored to include knowledge lost to the mortal races long ago.  With 
the ascension of a new God of Magic, one that seems to treasure the Art, as 
well as troubling portents seen among the stars, they have begun to make an 
appearance again on Tirradyn, with a select few venturing out from their 
	secluded homes to understand the new world they find themselves in. </p>

	<h2>Voidkin</h2>

<p>
The Voidkin are twisted versions of Nightkin and Starkin, 'cursed' in a way 
by the Jade Order of Rethia. The Voidkin are misfits.  Outcasts.  Even 
Arioch, which harbors all manner of folk without judgment, looks upon them 
with suspicion.  They are a creation of the Jade, and it is difficult for 
any of Rethian blood to trust them without reservation.  They are not evil, 
	but are considered 'darker' than their Starkin and Nightkin cousins.</p>
