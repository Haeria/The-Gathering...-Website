<p>The mage class is reserved for those people that show significant abilities 
with channeling the various forms of energy which exist within the world of 
Tirradyn.  While other classes may be able to touch upon those energies in 
smaller and weaker ways, ma/ges excel in manipulating them, resulting in a 
wide array of spells. </p>
<p>As mages learn and grow in power, they tend to specialize in one form of 
magic or another, resulting in the various mage classes which exist.  In 
combat, mages do fairly well with daggers and such, however they excel with 
staves, and if they are lucky enough to find one, some staves are able to 
have energies channeled through them to help focus a mages casting abilities 
for better effect.  All of the mage classes have generally the same 
abilities in combat, since their focus is mainly on honing their magical 
abilities. Though mages certainly may be either good or evil, or anywhere in 
between, the mage classes themselves aren't aligned in this fashion, so 
you'll be just as likely to run into an evil enchanter as you would a good 
psionic.</p>
<p>As indicated, there are various elemental and ephemeral spheres of energy 
which a mage can draw upon. The different elemental energy spheres available 
are: <strong>Fire</strong>, <strong>Water</strong>, <strong>Earth</strong>, 
<strong>Air</strong>, <strong>Shadow</strong>, <strong>Soul</strong>, 
<strong>Death</strong>, and <strong>Void</strong>.  These are the 
only energies which may be channeled and manipulated by the normal mortals 
of Tirradyn.  Most mages can use any or all of these either alone, or in 
conjunction with each other, though some are more difficult to work with 
without specializing in such fields.  All mage spells use one or more of 
these energies to power them, and these spheres may be meditated upon to 
raise or lower them so that specialization is possible.</p>
