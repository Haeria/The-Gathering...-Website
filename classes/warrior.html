<p>Warriors live for combat and the thrill of battle. They are the best 
  fighters of all the classes, but lack the subtle skills of thieves and the 
  magical talents of mages and clerics.  Warriors are best for those who don't 
  mind taking the direct approach, even when another method might be called 
  for.</p>
<p>Warriors begin with skill in the sword, and gain a second attack in combat. 
Other weapon skills may be purchased cheaply, or gained in the default skill 
package, which includes the following skills:<br/>
<strong>bash</strong> - a forceful rush with the body, designed to flatten your foes<br/>
<strong>enhanced damage</strong> - this skill multiplies your damage in battle<br/>
<strong>parry</strong> - the art of parrying with weapons<br/>
<strong>rescue</strong> - allows you to take the blows aimed for a companion<br/>
<strong>shield block</strong> - the art of parrying with a shield<br/>
<strong>disarm</strong> - used to deprive your opponent of his weapon<br/>
<strong>third attack</strong> - allows the skilled warrior to land three blows in one round<br/>
<strong>weaponsmaster</strong> - this group provides knowledge of all weapon types
