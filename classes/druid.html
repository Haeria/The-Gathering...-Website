					  <p>The druid class is for those that see nature as something grander than 
civilization and all that it entails.  They love nature in all of its forms, 
from the budding of a tiny flower to the violence of a tiger taking down an 
antelope.  Often they choose to dwell only in nature, giving up the cities 
and towns of the world to live among that which they love.  This isn't to 
say that they give up on people entirely, after all people are a part of 
nature too, and when people encounter druids, the meetings are generally 
pleasant enough in most circumstances. In living in the wilds, though, 
druids have developed their own standard of magic to both use nature for 
their purposes, and to commune with it and help it to thrive and sometimes 
fight when it seems it will be overwhelmed otherwise.</p>  

<p>In combat, druids are not the most fearsome class one might come across, 
but they do hold their own even sometimes against greater odds.  They excel 
with both staff and spear, and occasionally daggers, though they tend to 
eschew unnaturally made weapons such as swords and the like.  Druids can 
hail from any alignment, since both good and evil alike can foster a love 
and appreciation for nature, they are however, most often neutral, as most 
things of nature are.  </p>

<p>Druids also often choose to create a grove, where they imprint themselves, 
and can thereafter draw upon the strength of the plants within the grove to 
aid them.  If they choose to imprint themselves on a grove, however, their 
power and in some cases even their lives are tied to the health of the 
grove, so such groves must be tended well lest their unhealthiness drag the 
druid down. </p>
