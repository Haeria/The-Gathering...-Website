	<h3>Akahram</h3>
					  <p>Having been pushed from their greener homelands in Balmorral territories during the time of the great cleansing, the kingdom of Akahram now resides in the desert lands of Agragon. Well known followers of Death, they pay the god tribute and homage, for Death is inevitable for all things. Those of the Wulfruden and Akahramans having lived as one for a time, until war, not only with Balmorral but themselves divided the two. Fearing their own extinction they followed their Priest who led them to where the city is now. They are not overtly friendly with the outside world, and are highly secretive. No lycans who are shifted into their were forms are permitted entrance, and any who shift within are arrested on the spot, the wrath of Balmorral always within their thoughts and fears. Trade with them is hard to achieve, as is an alliance, but not impossible, so long as one follows their laws and shows them the respect they feel they deserve.</p>
	<h3>Balmorral</h3>
					  <p>Balmorral rules over most of Agragon and is a kingdom of holy zealots that is not only ruled by their King, but by the church that governs their lives. Believing themselves to be the Holy Cleansers whose one mission in life is to rid the realm of ALL evil. They do not accept outside trade with any, and will use whatever means necessary to strike the blight of the unholy from the realm. The undead are instantly slaughtered, those who practice witchery, arrested and tried. Demons, lycans, are given no quarter, animals given humanistic form seen as unclean. Only those full humans who bow to their one god would be given any respect, though even then, small. Entrance into their city must be gained through invitation or approval and trespass will be met with arrest. They are, the elite force in the realm, that even the largest and most powerful of empires give a wide berth to, never wanting to give reason for the Holy Zealots to cast their light upon them.</p>
	<h3>Dur'Amon</h3>
					  <p>Dur'Amon can be found in the upper north portion of Agragon within the cold damp regions. The village of giants are a robust, yet friendly type yet they are all governed by their own suspicions and fear of their neighbor, Balmorral. This fear leads them to prevent anyone that might be deemed unholy by Balmorral from entering their village. They do welcome outside trade with others, though it is difficult if one is not a giant, human or elf. Most seek them for their ships, that are said to be the best in the realm. These well made vessels are able to withstand attacks at sea better than all others.</p>
