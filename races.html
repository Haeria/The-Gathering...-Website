			  <h2>Race Name:  Nightkin</h2>
<p>
Nightkin are forged from the dark, cold expanse of space, that space 
between stars where light struggles to reach.  Their hair can range any 
color, from whites to blacks to varying hues all in one.  Their skin is any 
shade, so long as it is pale.  Their eyes trend toward cold, icy colors, or 
darker hues like blacks and greys.  Green and other colors are rare, but 
still occur.  Legend says that when a nightkin dies, his spirit departs the 
earthly remains in the form of a visible shadow.  Nightkin are primarily 
nocturnal creatures, and most of their worshipping and group rituals happen 
under the light of the moons.  When a Nightkin is born, their eyes are 
closed until they are lifted into the night sky and bathed in the darkness 
that is their domain.  Much like their Starkin cousins, the Nightkin do not 
have wings until puberty.  A faint tattoo of a pair of wings will grow and 
change as they age, revealing hints at what their wings will resemble when 
they finally appear.
		    </p><p>
When the Nightkin chooses to do so, they can make their wings vanish.  When 
the wings are hidden, the starburst mark on the wings, as well as the 
varying colors of the wings themselves, are transferred to the person's back 
as a tattoo. This vanishes, of course, when the wings are summoned again.

<h2>Race Name: Starkin</h2>
<p>
Star Kin are born of fire and the electricity of nebula. Their hair can 
range from pure white to orange and yellow, never black. Their hair crackles 
with sparks and their eyes, which may be almost every color, always hold 
pinpricks of white fire. They are the creatures of the light in the night 
sky.</p>

<h2>Race Name: Sekhym</h2>
<p>
The Sekhym Elves are an offshoot of the Sylvan Elves common to Tirradyn.  
They are not a new people to Tirradyn, but they are secretive.  Decades of 
negligence by the former Goddess of Magic led to them retreating into the 
deep, dark and wild places of Tirradyn, often eschewing large cities and the 
company of their elven cousins.  Despite being solitary, they are a friendly 
people, willing to go out of their way to help a stranger in need.  They are 
the self-proclaimed guardians of the leylines, the mortal lorekeepers of 
magic, rumored to include knowledge lost to the mortal races long ago.  With 
the ascension of a new God of Magic, one that seems to treasure the Art, as 
well as troubling portents seen among the stars, they have begun to make an 
appearance again on Tirradyn, with a select few venturing out from their 
	secluded homes to understand the new world they find themselves in. </p>

<h2>Race Name: Voidkin</h2>
<p>
The Voidkin are twisted versions of Nightkin and Starkin, 'cursed' in a way 
by the Jade Order of Rethia. The Voidkin are misfits.  Outcasts.  Even 
Arioch, which harbors all manner of folk without judgment, looks upon them 
with suspicion.  They are a creation of the Jade, and it is difficult for 
any of Rethian blood to trust them without reservation.  They are not evil, 
but are considered 'darker' than their Starkin and Nightkin cousins.<br>

<h1>Common Races</h1>
			  <h1>Giants</h1>
			  <h2>Cyclops*</h2>
			  <p>No info for this one yet.</p>
			  <h2>Fire-giant</h2>
			  <p>Fire-giants make their home within the furnaces of the world.  Living near,
in, and around volcanos and pools of magma has toughened their already tough
skin against the ravages of heat and flame and given, in most cases, a skin
tone of dark reddish brown.  They are, as all giants tend to be, heavily
muscled, however fire giants take this to new heights, often spending their
time in deep forges taking advantage of the heat they live in by hammering
away to create masterful works of armor and weaponry.  Though they tend to
stay clear of large cities, and other races, they enjoy the company of other
giants, and often gather in numbers to celebrate, tell stories, or just enjoy
occasional comradery.  They are known to sell their wares, sometimes camping
near towns and cities to do so, though they rarely wander in unless short on
supplies, or to visit friends. 
			  </p>
<h2>Half-giant</h2>
			  <p>Half-giants are born when giants mate with one of the many races they are
compatible with.  Though they can be born of a female giant mating with
males of other races, or to females of other races who have mated with a giant
male, the babies are usually so large that they often kill non-giant females
in childbirth, if not during the pregnancy.  Their physical characteristics
tend to be a blend of their two races, and their full height, generally
attained by the age of 25, is half-way between the two parents somewhere
between 7.5 to 9 feet tall.  They are generally ostracized by most giant
communities as half-breeds, though if the giant parent is well-liked, such
things are generally left unsaid and the child is at least partially
accepted.
			  </p>
<h2>Ice-giant</h2>
			  <p>Ice-giants inhabit the colder regions of the world, prefering ice and snow
to field and forest, and as such have built up high resistances to it.  They
are generally the same size as other giants, between 9 to 11 feet tall, but
they tend to have much more body and facial hair, one assumes as a genetic
defense against bitter cold winds.  They tend to be nomadic, traveling the
tundras in small groups, following the game that they hunt for food and hides.
They are a hardy folk, and are friendlier to outsiders much more so than the
other giant races.  The only time they leave their snowy wastelands is to
mingle in the large cities of the world selling furs, leather hides, and
other supplies that they make from those they hunt.  If one is traveling
through snowy lands, there is no better guide to have.
			  </p>
<h2>Mountain-giant</h2>
			  <p>Mountain-giants are the most rarely seen race of giants, usually only seen 
if one travels the mountain ranges where they make their homes.  They rarely 
come down to mingle with others, but younger mountain giants wandering the 
world is not unheard of, as their isolation tends to make young adults 
curious about the outside world.  They are the largest of giants, sometimes 
towering as high as 15 feet, and are very strong from all of the arduous 
climbing that they do.  They, like ice-giants, are resistant to the cold due 
to the often freezing temperatures in the higher mountains.  Their homes 
tend to be large caves hewn straight into mountain sides, though so much 
thought and skill goes into the hewing that those caves are very much like a 
home simply built from well-carved stone.  Though they do not choose to 
visit places outside of their mountains, they do not shun those that travel 
through their lands, and are willing to even help those that need supplies 
or guidance. 
			  </p>
<h2>Voadkyn</h2>
			  <p>Voadkyn, also called Wood Giants, are among the smallest of the giant-kin, 
standing only nine and a half feet tall on average with a weight of roughly 
seven hundred pounds. The have the same physical proportions as humans, 
giving them a thinner, lighter look than other Giants, but their facial 
features are more Elven than Human, giving them the appearance of 
giant-sized wood elves. They often refuse footwear, though they do wrap 
their ankles in strips of leather for support and protection. Voadkyn 
usually live in the same forests that Wood Elves favor, and the two races 
often co-exist, sharing a friendly bond with one another and the comforts 
nature provides in her forests that goes back to the time of the first 
legends, and likely existed even before these were written. Voadkyn do not 
have their own language, preferring to share the Elves’ own the way that 
they share their homes with one another. Voadkyn are widely known for their 
surprising litheness in such large bodies, as well as their natural 
intuitive ability.
			  </p>
			  <hr>
<h1>Humans</h1>
			  <h2>Human</h2>
			  <p>Ah, the human race. What can’t be said about them, really? Of all the 
strictly mortal races, they are perhaps the most evil, in their own way. 
Even more so than the Drow, with their mastery of deception, or Trolls, with 
their mastery of anything related to destroying peace and life, humans are 
known for causing strife and discord wherever they go. Some have described 
humans as a virus, constantly multiplying to spread their taint throughout 
the world, wherever they can survive long enough to build and breed. As a 
result, few humans are easily accepted into other cultures, as most races 
find them a hazardous influence, especially on their young. Humans 
themselves, on the other hand, are generally more accepting of other 
human-like races, such as dwarves and elves, though they are less likely to 
approve of half-bloods: half-orcs, half-elves and the like. As for physical 
characteristics, their skin tone varies from white to nearly black-brown, 
and all shades in between, as well as reddish or yellowish shades, though 
red is rarely seen anymore. They are capable of learning physical or magical 
forms of combat and defense with equal proficiency, and they have the 
intelligence required for deceit, tactics and politics. In a way, Humans are 
the most well-rounded race, capable of doing nearly anything they set their 
minds on doing with a modicum of success. It is this hardy 
jack-of-all-trades nature that allows the human race to survive its own 
self-destructive tendencies, and even thrive, amassing fortunes and empires 
superior to those of many other races in their spread around the world. </p>
<h2>valurian</h2><p>Valurians hail from the island city-state of Valuria and are a martial 
people, above all else.  Like most Humans, they have vary significantly in 
appearance, and do, with no specific coloration of hair, skin, or eyes 
predominating.  
Military service is compulsory and many Valurians can become quite wealthy 
off of it, but there is a distinct air of a meritocracy to the dealings of 
the Valurian military, as any favoritism or nepotism is frowned upon by 
their eccentric, dangerous, emperor Valurias.  
Of an average to slightly larger size compared to most Humans, Valurians 
are known for being opportunistic and aggressive, seeking to win and gain 
wealth and lands - all in the name of Empire.</p>
<h2>rethian</h2>
			  <p>The humans of Rethia are as varied and diverse as those found on Tirradyn 
before the Rethian continent was discovered.  Ranging from tall, to short 
and heavy to scrawny, with hair and eyes of many colors and hues, they are 
the embodiment of free will made manifest.  Good and evil play equal part in 
their lives, as does neutrality.  They range from all parts of Rethia.  
Axminster is one such settlement where humans are quite populous.  There are 
other villages scattered throughout the continent, and the major cities of 
Arioch and Avalon.  The humans of Rethia are like those of Tirradyn in 
nearly every way, save for the gods, and the history, that they are familiar 
with.</p>
			  <hr>
      <h1>Undead</h1>
			  <p></p>
<h2>banshee*</h2>
			  			  <p>When a soul passes on heavy with guilt or burning for revenge, it may return 
to the mortal plane as a tormented phantasm known as a Banshee. Forever 
locked in shadows and despair they creep through Tirradyn seeking out that 
which causes their eternal unrest, a killer perhaps or a task left 
unfinished before death, so that they may hopefully pass on to a peaceful 
rest guilt-free. As more and more Banshees appear and fail to find their 
rest, they have come to be recognized as a "race" in Tirradyn, as they do 
not appear to be going away any time soon. They tend to live close to their 
demon cousins or among the dead, often enjoying a power they never knew in 
life, but rarely enjoying this newfound strength with any true jubilation. 
Their horrendous wail can send the bravest warrior cowering in fear, or even 
strip his mind of sanity with the weight of countless years of unrelenting 
despair. </p>

<h2>dhampiel</h2>
<p>Of all the races in Tirradyn known openly as killers, Dhampiels are perhaps 
the most respected and feared. These are the progeny of humans and vampires, 
creatures neither truly alive or dead, though not undead either, a race 
caught in limbo between these states. Their bodies age to a certain point, 
generally into late puberty or their early twenties, and stop there, never 
adding another wrinkle. Known as "daywalkers" by their vampiric kin, 
Dhampiels are unaffected by sunlight, unlike Vampires, and are free to move 
and exercise their full powers during the day. They also lack the fearsome 
hunger for blood that haunts their vampire relations, but that hunger does 
exist within them it is simply quieter than in vampires, more easily ignored 
when temptation rises. Dhampiels are capable of eating solid foods and 
drinking fluids other than blood in addition to sating their hunger for that 
liquid life force, allowing them to blend in with human company more easily 
than a Vampire might, a talent often aided by the fact that most Dhampiels 
look perfectly human, letting them walk among the cattle, so to speak, until 
they must find their next meal. To date, the only recorded Dhampiels have 
been as described above, but a few alchemists have theorized that a similar 
creature may be spawned were a vampire ever to couple with something other 
than a human.</p>

<h2>Revenant</h2>
			  			  <p>A revenant is an undead being created when the moment of death is so traumatic
that it separates a person's life energy from their body very shockingly and
suddenly.  This life energy, composed mostly of the being's shadow energy
with a bit of what's left of the soul, is what primarily makes up the revenant's
form.  However, revenants are able to, with the expenditure of energy and effort,
able to create a solid form of itself appearing as it did in real life.  Only
those skilled in the knowledge of the undead could ever know the true nature
of a revenant.  Dissipating the corporeal body also takes some effort, however
much less than forming it, and it often leaves behind a small puddle of dark
sludge.  It should be noted that even revenants who have formed a corporeal body
will cast no shadow, and they often stand in or near shadows to mask this fact
from the world.</p>

			  <hr>
      <h1>Fae</h1>
			  
<h2>brownie</h2>
			  			  <p>Brownies appear as tiny bipedal beings that look surprisingly like small
elves with a greenish tint to their skin.  Rarely growing taller than around
a foot and a half, their hair and eye colors are usually earth tones in
browns and greens.  They are elusive creatures in the wild, choosing to live
in places untainted by the touch of civilization and often hiding when others
approach.  Occasionally brownies will leave their homes and mingle with
society, though whether they leave voluntarily or not is unknown.  Little is
known of their society either, however some reports indicate that it is
quite tribal, with brownie clusters being led by an elder, usually the eldest
of the brownies in that cluster.  They typically enjoy bright colors, and
their clothing reflects this, though it's a mystery how they manage to 
disappear into the forests with such bright attire.</p>

<h2>faerie</h2>
			  			  <p>Faeries tend to be a mischievous people found predominantly in sylvan 
settings, living in harmony with nature and often tormenting uninvited 
visitors.  Faeries speak their own tongue, a musical language more akin to 
singing than speech.  It is a rarity to find an outsider with any degree of 
fluency in this melodic language.  </p>

<h2>goblin</h2>
			  			  <p>Goblins are sometimes thought to be failed imps, hellish creatures thrown 
out of the inferno for being too small, too weak, too dull to survive in the 
flames of eternal damnation, but generally they aren’t even given that much 
credit. They’re small humanoids, four feet tall on average and under one 
hundred pounds, with flat faces, broad noses, pointed ears, and wide mouths 
with small, almost dainty, sharp fangs. The dull, glazed eyes of goblins 
range from bright red to putrid green to electric yellow, the latter being 
closest to matching their speech, which is usually high-pitched and harsh, 
voices designed for squabbling and infighting. Goblins prefer to live in 
dark caves and other underground havens, generally collecting into tribes 
with specific pecking orders in which every member knows his or her place, 
similar to the mentality of a wolf pack. Ascension within the pack is 
achieved through battle and goblins constantly fight with one another to 
improve their rank. Tribes of goblins take slaves for food and labor 
whenever possible, and these are constantly kept under guard, if not 
shackled. Rescued prisoners consistently recite horrors of watching their 
fellow captives being beaten, raped and consumed, and some are themselves 
recovered with fewer limbs than they had had before being captured. </p>

<h2>half-orc</h2>
			  			  <p>Bearing the traits of both Humans and Orcs, Half-orcs can sometimes pass as 
one or the other, though are usually very obviously a combination of the 
two. They tend to be a few inches shorter than their Orcish parent, bearing 
the same broad shoulders and heavily-muscled build, though to a lesser 
extreme. Half-orcs tend to vary quite a bit due to their human heritage, but 
males are generally are more hairy than most Humans. Their ears almost 
always are at least somewhat pointed, and their teeth sharper than what 
would be considered normal. Males also quite often develop side-burns, but 
rarely gain a full beard.</p>

<h2>orc</h2>
			  			  <p>The warrior-race of orcs is built for strength and combat. Ranging between 
six and seven feet in height and weighing from two hundred to a massive six 
hundred points of thick muscle, they are an intimidating sight for most 
races. Orcs tend to have long, pointed ears much like those of Elves. Their 
hair ranges across the human spectrum (with browns and reds more common than 
blondes), as well as a few shades of green. Similarly, their eyes range the 
entire human spectrum, as well as including red. Orcish males tend to be 
hairy, particularly their chests, arms, and legs. Strangely, this hairiness 
doesn't extend to facial hair. While Orcish males can easily grow goatees 
and side-burns, they rarely connect to a full beard, and it's nearly 
impossible for such facial hair to grow very long. Regardless, Orcs have 
usually tan skin, though darker shades aren't unknown in certain tribes, and 
Orcish teeth are sharp much like those found on canines. </p>

<h2>troll</h2>
			  			  <p>In a way, Trolls could be described as the twisted image of the Ursa. They 
have the size, the strength, the bulk and the communal mindset, and they 
carry as much hatred for life as the Ursa carry protective love of it. It is 
said that all things in nature require an opposite, a balance, and these 
must be the balance for those benevolent guardians of the forests. Little is 
known about these carnivorous destroyers, and most would rather it stayed 
that way. No one in reported history has ever been able to maintain a 
relationship of any kind with a Troll for more than a few days, as they 
never keep prisoners much longer than that even for entertainment. To the 
Trolls, pets are simply well-preserved meat. They are adaptable to the 
environment as needed, capable of living in nearly any climate, though few 
have ever been noted as thriving in desert conditions. The reason for this 
is unclear, but it is thought that trolls have some amphibious relation, 
making some form of moisture a necessity, or at least a comfort. This idea 
meshes with their physical characteristics, aside from the size and muscle 
mass, which include a rubbery, almost frog-like hide that ranges from sickly 
yellow to mottled green to midnight black. Trolls lack any sense of honor or 
morality without an outside influence bestowing such knowledge upon them, a 
rare occurrence, but have managed to cobble together their own guttural 
language, mostly from Human and Orcish sources with a few other tongues 
thrown in for flavor one of the first lessons Elvish rangers are taught is 
to listen for these baritone growls and brass-throated calls through the 
forest at night and to go in the other direction with all possible haste.</p>

			  <hr>
<h1>Demonic</h1>
<h2>daevulf</h2><p>Considered cursed creatures by most, the Daevulf are the crossbreed of a 
Mrem and a demonic creature. Daevulf generally have the same body structure 
and height as a Mrem, though with demonic features that plainly mark their 
heritage, such as horns, manes of fire, hooves, or glowing eyes. Many 
Daevulf are slim and agile like their Mremmish cousins, but some have gained 
heavier, more muscular builds due to their Demon parent. In all cases, 
however, fur color tends towards reddish tones, and Daevulf give off more 
heat than normal beings.</p>
<h2>deasune</h2><p>Deasune, known as Toad-Demons to some, are short creatures, ranging form 
three to under five feet in height. Possessing large, slitted eyes and an 
almost beak-like mouth, they really appear quite different from toads. They 
do have the green skin, however. Deasune limbs don't appear strong at first, 
but in the end are physically more powerful than almost any mortal race in 
the lands of Tirradyn, and they are far tougher, if a little slow. </p>
<h2>demon</h2><p>Demons, the denezins of the hells, are wide in variety and purpose. Besides 
the specific, more powerful, forms of demons, such as Succubi and the Fukai, 
lesser demons are formed for many other sinister purposes. The most common 
demonic form is known as the "Gargoyle" to the common folk: muscular brutes 
with sharp claws, hooved feet, red skin, and large, bat-like wings who 
delight in the destruction of others. Gargoyles, and almost all other 
varieties of demons save for the Succubi, Fukai, and Deasune, possess some 
form of horn as well. Of course, these are just the most common form of 
demon, and many demons possess the ability to assume the form of another 
race if they so choose. </p>
<h2>fellsworn</h2><p>Fellsworn are demonic elves.  They came about when groups of elves became 
trapped on nephilim and decided to make their home there.  Through 
generations of selective breeding, they have infused the best traits of 
demons and elves together.  They can be horned, though not all are.  None 
possess wings, though spaded tails are not unheard of.  They retain their 
normal elven qualities, though some are said to have darker, deep reddish 
skin, but they are stronger and more muscular than their elven cousins, and 
because of this have sacrificed some of their agile nature.</p>
<h2>fukai</h2><p>Fukai, known to commoners as simply Dog-Demons, are one of the most feared 
and powerful of the demonic races. Appearing as humans of about four and a 
half feet to seven feet in height, they are sometimes not recognized. 
However, closer inspection reveals sharp, vampire-like fangs, 
dangerously-sharp nails, and a pair of pointed dog-like ears. The hair of a 
Fukai tends towards white or other pale colors, occasionally darker shades 
can be found and eye color can vary wildly.  Only those of the Demon Courts 
can have a Mark in the center of their forehead.  The stripes seen on a 
Fukai represent how powerful they are and no mortal Fukai can have more than 
twin striping.  These beings have gained their colloquial name due to their 
ability to turn into huge, demonic dogs of great power, but most mortals 
will never see a Dog-Demon in this form.</p>
<h2>gnojni</h2><p>Gnojnis are sometimes thought to be failed imps, hellish creatures thrown 
out of the inferno for being too small, too weak, too dull to survive in the 
flames of eternal damnation, but generally they aren't even given that much 
credit. They're small humanoids, four feet tall on average and under one 
hundred pounds, with flat faces, pointed elf-like ears, and wide mouths with 
small, almost dainty, sharp fangs. The oddly bright, glazed eyes of Gnojni 
range from bright red to emerald green to electric yellow, the latter being 
closest to matching their speech, which is usually high-pitched and fast, 
voices designed for squabbling and to ensure they are heard. Gnojni prefer 
to live in dark caves and other underground havens, generally collecting 
into tribes with specific pecking orders in which every member knows his or 
her place, similar to the mentality of a wolf pack. Its not however uncommon 
for a Gnojni to take up in a fancy castle or other living environment if 
given the chance, and will enjoy every second of being spoiled. Ascension 
within the pack is achieved through battle even by looks they constantly 
fight with one another to try to improve their rank. Tribes of Gnojni take 
slaves for food and labor whenever possible, and these are constantly kept 
under guard, if not shackled. Rescued prisoners consistently recite horrors 
of watching their fellow captives being beaten, raped and consumed, and some 
are themselves recovered with fewer limbs than they had had before being 
captured. Gnojni's are a race thrown from to the bottom of the social ladder 
that try hard to gain a place of respect with the rest of the world, even if 
it means betraying their own.</p>
<h2>hanyou</h2><p>The Hanyou are, in essense, half-demons. Hanyou are generally half Human, 
though Elven, Orcish, and Dwarven Hanyou aren't unheard of, and half-demon 
of any subspecies. Because of this, Hanyou vary wildly in appearance, but 
all bear markings of their demonic half, through animal ears, sharp nails, 
and sharp teeth. Strangely, more powerful Demons tend to spawn Hanyou that 
more closely resemble their mortal half, but never can a Hanyou appear 
totally unmarked by Demonic traits. </p>
<h2>imp</h2><p>No helpfile currently</p>
<h2>succubus</h2><p>Known colloquially as Pleasure Demons, Succubi and their more rare, male 
versions, Incubi, are the seducers of the hells. Like most demons, Pleasure 
Demons can vary wildly in appearance. One thing they all have in common, 
however, is that their forms are designed to inspire lust in mortals. Most 
Succubi and Incubi look like hauntingly beautiful or handsome Humans, save 
for a pair of wings (bat-like, dragon-like, and black feathered being most 
common) and a slender tail. Build can vary between the Demons, as can 
eye-color and hair-color. Still, Succubi and Incubi with the forms of other 
humanoids aren't unknown, Elves being the most common, though a few designed 
to target other races being more rare, but still present.</p>

<h1>Hybrid</h1>
			  <h2>avian</h2><p>Avians are the only airborne hybrid of man and beast: every Avian has a 
fully grown set of wings that allows them to move across the skies with 
little strain or effort. Avians usually have feathers covering most of their 
body and, when applicable, tails, though some breeds of Avian are less 
"pure" than others and may lack some of these details. For this same reason 
some Avians have beaks and more angular faces while others’ faces are more 
humanoid. They differ from their bird heritage in size, being closer to the 
size of humans, albeit usually a touch shorter, and in their limbs, as they 
have arms in addition to legs and wings. Avians come in all colors and 
patterns, depending on what sort of bird they most resemble, and they live 
in tightly knit groups in mountain aeries, communicating with one another in 
their own musical language that seems very confusing to those not born into 
it. The Faeries of Tirradyn and Avians tend to get along with one another 
slightly better than with other races if for no other reason than their 
mutual respect for nature and the similarities in their respective 
languages, allowing for easier communication between the two races.</p>
<h2>cinsiyet</h2><p>Cinsiyets are truly an out of this world race, they birthplace is none other 
then Tirradyn’s moon Sazaa. Its unknown how they’ve made it from the watery 
moon down to the Tirradyn, but myth and legion suggest they’ve been visiting 
for a long time. Often called the Angels of the Sea, Cinsiyets are almost 
always polite and friendly, even forgiving to a fault. While its true they 
live in water, their fragile skin is unable to handle the harsh seawater of 
Tirradyn’s oceans. Most Cinsiyets have long hair, usually in different 
shades of green or blue or a mix of the two. Their eye colors know no limits 
and can be any color of the rainbow. Their toes and fingers have webbing 
they can expand while in the water to allow them to swim better, but that 
they can lower away while on the land to protect the thin membranes. From 
swimming so much, its rare to see an out of shape Cinsiyet, and while 
they’re home is under the fresh clean waters of Sazaa they have no problems 
taking to a life on land. They speak a beautifull language that some may 
consider to be quite musical and ethereal.</p>
<h2>draconian</h2><p>Draconians are a proud race of dragon-like humanoids. Their key defining 
features are their leathery scales, sharp claws, and webbed wings, though 
there is a lot more to them than that. Draconians come from a rare paring of 
human and dragon many generations ago, and because of that, share 
characteristics between the two. Although most Draconians share the same 
aspects, depending on how close their ancestry is to their Dragon forefather 
they may be more human like or more dragon related. Like humans, Draconians 
are bipedal and posture-wise tend to stand straight, preferring their full 
height to slouching in almost all situations. No matter what, Draconians are 
always covered in leathery, armor-like scales that come in a variety of 
colors. The most common are red, black, green, white, and blue, although 
they do rarely come in more metallic gold, bronze, and rarely silver. 
Draconians with strange magical heritage have been known to have wilder 
colors such as pink or purple, although these are often rare and 
one-of-a-kind. They also all sport dangerous claws which are sharp enough to 
be used as weapons, but do not reduce the dexterity of their fingers.</p>
<h2>equis</h2><p>Equis are a race of human-horse hybrids similar in form to minotaurs and 
Mrem, with regard to the general amalgam of characteristics. The range of 
equine characteristics in a given Equis varies in each individual. Most 
appear mainly human in body with heads more akin to horses, including a mane 
and long face with large eyes, lips, and flat teeth. Some have hooves 
instead of hands or feet. All have long flowing tails. Hair and hide 
coloration varies from white to black to brown to red, plain, striped, 
spotted, patchy, or a mess of any of the above. A populated Equis territory 
contains a menagerie of shapes, styles, and colors in its inhabitants' 
hides. The grounds inhabited by Equis are referred to as their territories 
as structures are largely nonexistent among their kind: they live in the 
open wherever possible and range freely across a vast spread of land over 
the course of a year's seasonal shifts. Though Equis rarely own their 
territories in any official sense, few have either the energy or inclination 
to try to force them out of the lands once an Equis family has taken up 
residence.</p>
<h2>jalachara</h2><p>Jalachara are similar to Mrem and rawulf and all the other hybrid races, a 
biped form with animalistic features, in this case those of a lizard. Unlike 
Lizardmen(women) they are much less savage and their scales are smaller, 
still larger and thicker then skin but much more flexible and soft. It is 
because of their smaller scales that the Jalachara have moved from living 
mostly in swamps and marshlands to settle rain forest and jungles. The 
scales on a Jalachara need to stay moist or they'll crack and bleed, which 
keeps the Jalachara living close to water or in very wet environments. They 
are typically more savage then mrem or rawulf, omnivores with a preference 
for meat, semi-aquatic in nature with cold blood. They thrive on scavenging, 
pillaging and, in less hostile times, fishing and gathering, and hunting 
less-than-sentient races, it is not unheard of for Jalachara to farm both 
plants and animals when given the land to do so.</p>
<h2>kitven</h2><p>One of the amalgam races, the Kitven (called Ratlings by some) are humanoids 
that possess the traits of rodents, specifically rats or mice. Thin and 
lanky, they possess a quickness and agility seen by very few other races. 
Like their animal cousins, they also possess thin fur over their bodies, and 
beady eyes. Their ears vary depending on the specific Kitven, some with 
large ears like mice, others smaller. They all have feet and hands with 
sharp, if short, claws. </p>
<h2>merfolk</h2><p>A majestic, beautiful race, the merfolk hold themselves in high regard, 
but are not above shunning their own should a fellow merperson exhibit evil 
tendencies. Those who fall to darkness are exiled from the seas. Due to the fact that nearly any merperson a land-dwelling person encounters is likely to encounter is experiencing the world during their 
Calling, perceptions of the race tend to be that of the precocious, exceptionally curious phase. It's not uncommon for merfolk to take a newfound friend under the water and drown them, having forgotten that 
land-walkers cannot breathe without air.</p>
<h2>mrem</h2><p>The Mrem are a bipedal feline race they have an almost humanoid frame, 
similar in height and stature to the average human, but their other major 
characteristics are more cat-like than human. They bear long, soft, furred 
tails which they often conceal under their clothing when wearing any, and 
their ears are triangular, giving them an impressive hearing range but 
doubling as a vulnerability to loud or sharp noises. Slit-pupils are 
centered in their feline eyes, eyes that allow them to see exceptionally 
well in low-light conditions, and a sensitive nose provides them with a 
superhuman sense of smell. They are agile creatures with lightning quick 
reflexes, as one might expect from a race of cats. Mrem speak in a language 
known simply as Mremish their young are known as kits, but little else is 
commonly shared from their culture with those considered outsiders. It is 
known that they are taught from an early age to hate and fear reptiles by 
the elder generations, and apparently a similar dislike is taught to kits 
with regard to the Vesrine, as these two races never seem to get along, but 
then that may simply be instinctual. While some Mrem have been known to 
experience a cyclic mating urge, "heat", its timing is inconsistent and not 
all members of their race seem to be afflicted by this trait it may be 
little more than another Human myth.</p>
<h2>rawulf</h2><p>Often confused for werewolves, Rawulves are humanoids with the 
characteristics of canines. Ranging between six and seven feet in height and 
betweeen two hundred twenty to six hundred pounds in weight, Rawulves are 
often tall, muscular, and generally intimidating for smaller races. Most 
commonly displaying the characteristics of wolves or hyenas, Rawulves 
looking like other canines aren't unheard of. All Rawulves have tails, 
canine teeth, and sharp claws, as well as a thick pelt of fur around their 
bodies that protects them from even the harshest cold.  Their facial 
features are also canine-like, having snouts, canine noses, and large ears.</p>
<h2>ursa</h2><p>Few could mistake, or miss, the sight of an Ursa. Standing between seven and 
eight feet in height and weighing between three to seven hundred pounds, 
this race of bear-men are quite easy to spot. The Ursa are a race of 
humanoids that possesses the traits of bears. Bear-like features are 
dominant on their faces, featuring a snout, bear-like ears, and a rather 
sharp set of teeth. Fur covers the entire body, usually white, brown, or 
black, though reddish-brown hues are not uncommon. Powerful claws are also 
present on the hands and feet, combined with a great strength making even an 
unarmed Ursa a deadly opponent. </p>
<h2>vesrine</h2><p>Vesrine are often considered smaller cousins of humans. Their height to the 
tops of their head average around 3 ½ feet and range from the short 3 foot 
to the tall 4 ½ feet. 5-foot tall vesrine are very rare. They have a very 
similar build, limbs, digits except for a few features. Vesrine are 
Digitigrade, walking on their toes as opposed to flat footed, and have great 
leaping capabilities. An average vesrine can jump their own height and while 
sprinting tends to leap instead of run, as they can cover long distances in 
a single bound. The race also tends to have a ranging amount of fur 
depending on their family’s home continent. In sandy hot areas like near the 
Desert of Lost Dreams on Tu-Lips, vesrine may only have fur on their ears, 
tail, and extremities, while more cold areas like the snow fields of 
Elzothis may be covered with thick, shaggy fur.</p>
<h2>Tasellu (Player Made?)</h2>
<p>Though glimpses of them have been occasionally reported by trappers and 
rangers through the years, the Tasellu race was long thought to be a myth.  
This race of simian hybrids, though, have recently made themselves known, 
slipping out of their jungle hideaways for reasons known only to them.  
Ranging in size from four feet to nearly seven, they seem to have a range of 
types from baboons to chimpanzees, to gorillas, and everything in between.  
Being bipedal hybrids, much like the others of the realm, their features 
take on differing aspects of both humanoid and simian characteristics.  Fur 
and tails are usually present in some form, save the tailless apes.  
Coloring seems to vary widely as well, though only to shades helpful in 
hiding in nature.  They are a close-knit society, but seem somewhat 
hierarchical with certain species seeming to rank over others.  They are 
wary of other races, but are open and friendly enough.</p>
<h2>felindred&nbsp;(Player Made?)</h2>
<p> The Fierlan are long-time residents of a secret kingdom hidden far away 
from prying eyes. Like the Faedra the Fierlan have also adapted to a 
lifestyle in the clouds, though they spend long amounts of time in gardens, 
holed up in temples, or sequestered in arcane towers. They are Faedra that 
have given themselves to the mana almost entirely, transforming their bodies 
into vessels capable of wielding great mana.</p>
<h2>faedra&nbsp;(Player Made?)</h2> 
<p>The Faedra are long-time residents of a secret kingdom hidden far away from 
prying eyes along with another race called the Fierlan, the Faedra adapted 
to a lifestyle in the clouds. They are the main transport of the cloud 
kingdom. They carry building materials and various other things to and fro, 
as well as others on occasion. The secondary form of a Faedra grows with 
age, the oldest growing large enough to transport many people. The oldest 
living Faedra recorded was around 650 years old when they passed away, 
resulting in a body length of twenty seven feet.</p>

      <h1>Elven</h1>
<h2>drow</h2><p>Drow are the dark mirrors of Elves, more so than even Trolls are to the 
Ursa. Drow are nearly identical to Wood Elves in every physical respect, 
save that Drow are slightly weaker and smaller than Elves, and the skin of a 
Drow is the black of nights after the stars have all died. Their eyes are 
generally deep red, violet or black, and their hair only grows on the grey 
scale, most often seen in white or varying shades of grey. Black hair is 
rarely seen on a Drow, though according to myth it was once their only 
color, in the times when they were warriors supreme. Most give these myths 
little credit, believing them to be nothing more than Drow lies to try and 
build some legend of past power they never had. These skeptics are sometimes 
shaken by the revelation that those dark-haired Drow that do exist are often 
superior killers, but this is eventually named nothing more than 
coincidence. Drow are a subterranean race, living in caverns beneath the 
earth, and their vision in the dark is second to none. Drow are faster than 
humans and more agile, though their dexterity cannot outmatch that of Elves. 
Their society is matriarchal, with females heading each family and standing 
as the high priestesses to all the gods. Males are typically trained as 
warriors and mages, though many turn to thievery when they fail in their 
apprenticeships. </p>
<h2>elf</h2><p>All Elves tend to be shorter and slimmer than humans, ranging from five to 
six feet in height and weighing roughly between eighty to one hundred and 
twenty pounds.  Alluring features that are delicate and refined, seemed 
sculpted at times with smooth cheekbones, small lips, elliptical eyes and 
efficient noses, in addition to their trademark tipped ears.  Hypnotically 
serene eyes come in all manner of colors: lavender, ice-blue, clover and 
jade, periwinkle, all the shades of the good earth, all the streams of the 
rainbow, all the tones of the night sky, from the marble white of passing 
clouds to the absolute darkness of a moonless, starless midnight.  Their 
hair colors tend to mingle in range within most normal tones and 
hightlights.</p>
<h2>half-elf</h2><p>Human traits rarely seem to come out on top when mixed with more mystical 
blood, as is evident in both Half-orcs and Half-elves. In the case of 
Half-elves, though, this mixture is quite beneficial, granting them both the 
strength and hardiness of humans, or close to it, and the handsome, or 
beautiful, features associated with elves, along with their agility, 
dexterity, and affinity with nature. They mingle relatively well with 
humans, but are not always well accepted by their elven kin, who have been 
known to consider such half-bloods abominations, mostly dependant upon which 
side of the coupling was elven, and whom the parents were according to 
class. Still, their exclusion from either side of the racial pool is nowhere 
near so extreme as it typically is for Half-orcs. They are slightly taller 
than most elves, and heavier, and as they are more freely brought into human 
communities they typically speak human tongues and follow their trade sense, 
rather than Elves’.</p>
<h2>high-elf</h2><p>High elves consider themselves to be the purest of all the elven races, their
pride besting even that of the proudest drow.  Because of this, they are
often thought of by other elves as being unbearably haughty.  They tend to
take this pride in their purity to such extremes that one of their numbers
caught dallying with a lower race is often punished harshly.  High-elf females
that give birth to half-breeds are exiled entirely from the society, often
after a severe whipping.  In some cases, the half-breed child is killed to
prevent high-elf blood from mixing with that of the lower races when it grows
to an adult.  While they see the other elven races as impure, the double this
opinion of the drow, often seeing them as the lowest of the low, and there is
a hatred between the high-elves and the drow that often erupts into skirmishes
and at times minor wars.  Because of their racial purity, the features of
high-elves are more pronounced.  Their ears are longer somewhat, their limbs
more lithe and agile, and their facial features more elven in appearance.
Most all of them have lightly colored hair, white to yellow-gold.  Their eyes
are almost always blue or green, though the occasional golden-eyed high-elf is
born.</p>
<h2>moon-elf</h2><p>Moon-Elves come in two varieties, those who were born upon the moons of
Tirradyn, and those that choose to dwell in the moonlight that covers the
world at night.  Some speculate that the latter revere the moons so much
because at some point in their history, their ancestors dwelt upon them, but
moon-elves are notorious for living in the moment and tending to ignore, and
thus not keep histories on, such things as ancestry and origin.  As they tend
to move about mostly at night when the moons are shining, they have very fair
complexions, and their hair color tends to be darker shades of brown and black,
though some lighter-haired moon-elves are occasionally born.  Their choice of
dwelling seems not to be very important to them, though their homes do tend to
be near open fields where the moons shine down unhindered by trees.  Some
communities choose living in the trees as their wood-elf cousins do, while
others choose to build small homes on the ground if there are no large trees
near the spot they have chosen to make home.  Being a spontaneous elven race,
they revel in the present, and their society reflects this, with leadership
of them being passed around seemingly at a whim to outsiders, and though it
does have a structure, the intricacies of it are lost on those of other
races.</p>
<h2>shikigami-elf</h2><p>The Shikigami are an off-shoot of the Elven race, much like the Drow. This 
is obvious by their appearence, bearing lithe, graceful forms that is 
natural to the entire Elven race. Also like their High Elven cousins, the 
Shikigami Elves have long, pointed ears. They differ, however, in that their 
skin tends towards more bronzed complexions as opposed to the standard Elven 
fairness, and their hair favors shades of red and brown compared to standard 
Elven blonde. The Shikigami range between five to six feet in height and 
weigh between eighty and a hundred and fifty pounds. They never develop 
significant fat, but have been known to be able to hold more toned, muscular 
builds than their High Elven counterparts, though still not to the degree a 
Human could reach.</p>
<h2>snow-elf</h2><p>Snow-elves have chosen to make their homes in the colder places of the world,
usually out of the snow and ice that make up the environment, often crafting
wondrous homes of ice crystals and solid blocks of frozen snow.  They have a
high resistance to cold, and warmer climes tend to make them somewhat sweaty
and uncomfortable, but if they spend enough time in warmer weather, they adapt
fairly well.  Their physical appearance tends to mirror their environment, 
leaning toward fair complexions and lighter colored hair.  It is said that if
one walks across a flat field of snow, you could walk past a dozen snow-elves
hiding against the white of it and never notice them.  Since they cannot farm,
they have become hunters through generations, often forming large hunting
parties to track large herds of beasts wandering the snowy lands, and are
known for utilizing trained timber wolves in their hunts.  Their leadership
is a well structured hierarchy with both men and women holding seats of power
among them.</p>
<h2>sun-elf</h2><p>Sun-elves are the most mysterious of elven kin, and little is known about them
outside of their communities.  At times they seem to be tribal, and at others
a fine-tuned creation of democracy.  With their tanned skin, and their hair
of red to blonde colors, they are often mistaken for their shikigami cousins
at first, and while they do resemble them in appearance, they hold a little
more pride in what they are as a race.  They revere the sun, and bask in its
rays, often choosing climes where the sun shines most often without cloud
cover or rainy weather, sometimes even dwelling deep in the deserts where
clouds are scarcist.  They are the least agile of the elven races, though
they make up for it with some added strength and durability.  As a society
they are hunter-gatherers in most climates, as farms tend to require rainfall
which they dislike.  They have no dislike for outsiders, and will openly
interact with them if occasion arises, but they will not seek out such
interactions.</p>
<h2>sylvan-elf</h2><p>Sylvan-elves are the more mystical kin of all the elven races, often excelling
in the magical arts be they druidic, clerical, or mage-like.  They make their
homes near to what they call 'magical ley lines', where magical powers are
said to be the strongest, and those dwellings depend on the environment, be
it within trees, fabricated homes, underground caverns, or anything in between.
Their appearance varies widely as well, with skin tones, hair color, and eye
color running the whole spectrum of possibilities.  One thing that most of
the sylven-elves have in common though, are their tattoos, usually of magical
runes or other mystical symbols and patterns, and some say that these markings
both increase their spellcasting abilities, and mark their places in the
hierarchy of society.  They are a mysterious race, often secretive about their
arts and culture, but they are welcoming of outsiders as long as those people
do not pry too deeply into their secrets.</p>
<h2>water-elf</h2><p>Water-elves choose to dwell around as much water as possible.  Though they
prefer lakes and rivers, they have been known to dwell on oceanfronts as well.
They excel in diving and swimming, and their bodies have adapted to this over
generations, allowing them to hold their breath for very long periods of time.
Some have developed webbing between their fingers, though not all have, and
some are even said to possess gills, though whether this is true or not isn't
clear.  They are a fishing people, no matter the body of water they are near,
and lake-dwellers are well-known for their boat-making abilities, and for
sailing the lake's surface to fish deeper waters.  In appearance, they are
much like their wood-elf cousins, and those dwelling along riverbanks often
make homes in the trees along the banks.</p>
<h2>wood-elf</h2><p></p>
<h2>sekhym</h2><p>The Sekhym Elves are an offshoot of the Sylvan Elves common to Tirradyn.  
They are not a new people to Tirradyn, but they are secretive.  Decades of 
negligence by the former Goddess of Magic led to them retreating into the 
deep, dark and wild places of Tirradyn, often eschewing large cities and the 
company of their elven cousins.  Despite being solitary, they are a friendly 
people, willing to go out of their way to help a stranger in need.  They are 
the self-proclaimed guardians of the leylines, the mortal lorekeepers of 
magic, rumored to include knowledge lost to the mortal races long ago.  With 
the ascension of a new God of Magic, one that seems to treasure the Art, as 
well as troubling portents seen among the stars, they have begun to make an 
appearance again on Tirradyn, with a select few venturing out from their 
secluded homes to understand the new world they find themselves in.</p>
			  <hr>
      <h1>dwarven</h1>
<h2>duergar</h2><p>The Duergar are more commonly known as Grey Dwarves, a malevolent breed of 
Dwarf that is most often found at extreme depths beneath the earth. They 
prefer drap clothing designed to act as subtle camouflage, blending in with 
their rough underground homes, as though the darkness were not enough to 
hide them. Duergar society is very harsh because of the hostile environment 
in which they are usually found in these steaming depths, the strong are 
truly the only ones who can survive. They are more intelligent and dexterous 
than their Dwarf cousins, but usually weaker and less hardy, much the way 
that the Drow are weaker than their Elven kin, though Duergar are typically 
a bit larger than Dwarves, if only by a few inches. They speak the Dwarven 
language, but they do not at all enjoy the company of dwarves, and the two 
races usually attack one another on sight. </p>
<h2>dwarf</h2><p>Dwarves are the tallest of the "miniature" races, but this does not by any 
means make them tall. They are stocky fellows easily identified by their 
diminutive size, wide and muscular build, and their abundant facial hair of 
which they are very proud, often braiding their wiry beards into intricate 
patterns before work or battle. They are known for their strength and 
courage, if not particularly for their intelligence, as well as their 
insatiable appetites for beer, ale, mead and stronger drink. Dwarves like 
the earth and dislike the sea, the latter no doubt due in part to their 
stubby limbs being unsuited to swimming. They are not overly fond of elves 
and have a fierce hatred of orcs and goblins, attacking the latter two as 
well as their own Duergar cousins on sight much of the time. Dwarves 
typically dwell in hilly or mountainous regions where caves are plentiful. 
Though not very charismatic according to the judgment of non-dwarf races, 
and not particularly swift, dwarves have an awesome endurance that makes 
them very difficult to keep down in a fight.</p>
<h2>halfling</h2><p>Halflings, much as their name implies, are small humanoids, generally two to 
four feet in height and ranging between forty to a hundred pounds. Halflings 
to have rather plump bodies, with dark, curly hair atop their heads and 
feet. Their feet are also disproportionately large, making them dislike 
shoes, though they don't need them thanks to the thick soles on the bottoms 
of their feet. Halfling eye colors have the same range that Humans do, and 
they are naturally agile and rarely make a sound when they walk. </p>
			  <hr>
      <h1>special</h1>
<h2>ambar</h2><p>The Ambar Nelath are bathed in the golden hue, covering their skin in a 
casting of rich brilliance, often with a glittery pearl sheen. Not elven and 
not angelic, the Nelath are a unique and incredible sight to behold. Their 
facial features often lean to elven or half-elven heritage, with the slender 
and shapely ears, beautiful and stately structure. Their physical build 
leans more to the strength of an avenging angel. The theory is that these 
beings are a tribute to the God known as the Amber Knight and the great 
Barbediel, or as some rumors suggest, their own creation to come into being 
at the time they did.</p>
			  
<h2>darkling</h2><p>Darklings are perhaps the least understood race upon Tirradyn.  They are 
neither a natural race, nor a race specifically created by anyone.  Instead, 
they are a product of the consequences of misplaced magic and time.  It 
happens upon occasion that a person becomes trapped in the shadow world 
either through a malfunctioning magical portal, or in tampering with shadow 
magics. Over time, this person changes within the shadow world, losing their 
physical form and most, if not all, memories of their former life.  Their 
shape alters and eventually becomes nothing more than an ephemeral memory of 
what it once was.  Darklings in this form may escape from the shadow world, 
but must take on a form while in the material realm. The energy to do this 
is taxing, and darklings were once required to consume souls in order to 
maintain a form for very long, however Trellan devised a means of protecting 
the world from the hunger of the escaping darklings by binding their energy 
to his own, thereby giving them the ability to maintain their form while 
increasing his own strength, though the darklings need not serve him in any 
way. Darklings would consume these souls by killing their victim, then upon 
death, they absorb it from the dying/dead corpse.</p>
			  
<h2>saurot</h2> <p> The theory is that these beings are a tribute to the Goddess Zranic and 
the Goddess Kasim, or as some rumors suggest, their own creation to come 
into being at the time they did. Silver skinned with faint blue, red, purple 
or black tinting. Saurots have slender forms generally and can reach heights 
of seven feet, resulting in lean and lanky appearances. Some of the Saurots 
can have a skeletal build to their form, while others can be quite curvy. 
Pasty skin is often (Not always) an attribute of the race and can be tacky 
to the touch, much like blood itself when freshly spilled. Some Saurots can 
appear perfectly healthy with no signs of illness, while others tend to lean 
toward sickly appearances, with no actual causes.</p>
