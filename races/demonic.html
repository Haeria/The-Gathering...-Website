      <h1>Demonic</h1>
<h2>Daevulf</h2><p>Considered cursed creatures by most, the Daevulf are the crossbreed of a 
Mrem and a demonic creature. Daevulf generally have the same body structure 
and height as a Mrem, though with demonic features that plainly mark their 
heritage, such as horns, manes of fire, hooves, or glowing eyes. Many 
Daevulf are slim and agile like their Mremmish cousins, but some have gained 
heavier, more muscular builds due to their Demon parent. In all cases, 
however, fur color tends towards reddish tones, and Daevulf give off more 
heat than normal beings.</p>
<h2>Deasune</h2><p>Deasune, known as Toad-Demons to some, are short creatures, ranging form 
three to under five feet in height. Possessing large, slitted eyes and an 
almost beak-like mouth, they really appear quite different from toads. They 
do have the green skin, however. Deasune limbs don't appear strong at first, 
but in the end are physically more powerful than almost any mortal race in 
the lands of Tirradyn, and they are far tougher, if a little slow. </p>
<h2>Demon</h2><p>Demons, the denezins of the hells, are wide in variety and purpose. Besides 
the specific, more powerful, forms of demons, such as Succubi and the Fukai, 
lesser demons are formed for many other sinister purposes. The most common 
demonic form is known as the "Gargoyle" to the common folk: muscular brutes 
with sharp claws, hooved feet, red skin, and large, bat-like wings who 
delight in the destruction of others. Gargoyles, and almost all other 
varieties of demons save for the Succubi, Fukai, and Deasune, possess some 
form of horn as well. Of course, these are just the most common form of 
demon, and many demons possess the ability to assume the form of another 
race if they so choose. </p>
<h2>Fellsworn</h2><p>Fellsworn are demonic elves.  They came about when groups of elves became 
trapped on nephilim and decided to make their home there.  Through 
generations of selective breeding, they have infused the best traits of 
demons and elves together.  They can be horned, though not all are.  None 
possess wings, though spaded tails are not unheard of.  They retain their 
normal elven qualities, though some are said to have darker, deep reddish 
skin, but they are stronger and more muscular than their elven cousins, and 
because of this have sacrificed some of their agile nature.</p>
<h2>Fukai</h2><p>Fukai, known to commoners as simply Dog-Demons, are one of the most feared 
and powerful of the demonic races. Appearing as humans of about four and a 
half feet to seven feet in height, they are sometimes not recognized. 
However, closer inspection reveals sharp, vampire-like fangs, 
dangerously-sharp nails, and a pair of pointed dog-like ears. The hair of a 
Fukai tends towards white or other pale colors, occasionally darker shades 
can be found and eye color can vary wildly.  Only those of the Demon Courts 
can have a Mark in the center of their forehead.  The stripes seen on a 
Fukai represent how powerful they are and no mortal Fukai can have more than 
twin striping.  These beings have gained their colloquial name due to their 
ability to turn into huge, demonic dogs of great power, but most mortals 
will never see a Dog-Demon in this form.</p>
<h2>Gnojni</h2><p>Gnojnis are sometimes thought to be failed imps, hellish creatures thrown 
out of the inferno for being too small, too weak, too dull to survive in the 
flames of eternal damnation, but generally they aren't even given that much 
credit. They're small humanoids, four feet tall on average and under one 
hundred pounds, with flat faces, pointed elf-like ears, and wide mouths with 
small, almost dainty, sharp fangs. The oddly bright, glazed eyes of Gnojni 
range from bright red to emerald green to electric yellow, the latter being 
closest to matching their speech, which is usually high-pitched and fast, 
voices designed for squabbling and to ensure they are heard. Gnojni prefer 
to live in dark caves and other underground havens, generally collecting 
into tribes with specific pecking orders in which every member knows his or 
her place, similar to the mentality of a wolf pack. Its not however uncommon 
for a Gnojni to take up in a fancy castle or other living environment if 
given the chance, and will enjoy every second of being spoiled. Ascension 
within the pack is achieved through battle even by looks they constantly 
fight with one another to try to improve their rank. Tribes of Gnojni take 
slaves for food and labor whenever possible, and these are constantly kept 
under guard, if not shackled. Rescued prisoners consistently recite horrors 
of watching their fellow captives being beaten, raped and consumed, and some 
are themselves recovered with fewer limbs than they had had before being 
captured. Gnojni's are a race thrown from to the bottom of the social ladder 
that try hard to gain a place of respect with the rest of the world, even if 
it means betraying their own.</p>
<h2>Hanyou</h2><p>The Hanyou are, in essense, half-demons. Hanyou are generally half Human, 
though Elven, Orcish, and Dwarven Hanyou aren't unheard of, and half-demon 
of any subspecies. Because of this, Hanyou vary wildly in appearance, but 
all bear markings of their demonic half, through animal ears, sharp nails, 
and sharp teeth. Strangely, more powerful Demons tend to spawn Hanyou that 
more closely resemble their mortal half, but never can a Hanyou appear 
totally unmarked by Demonic traits. </p>
<h2>Imp</h2><p>No helpfile currently</p>
<h2>Succubus</h2><p>Known colloquially as Pleasure Demons, Succubi and their more rare, male 
versions, Incubi, are the seducers of the hells. Like most demons, Pleasure 
Demons can vary wildly in appearance. One thing they all have in common, 
however, is that their forms are designed to inspire lust in mortals. Most 
Succubi and Incubi look like hauntingly beautiful or handsome Humans, save 
for a pair of wings (bat-like, dragon-like, and black feathered being most 
common) and a slender tail. Build can vary between the Demons, as can 
eye-color and hair-color. Still, Succubi and Incubi with the forms of other 
humanoids aren't unknown, Elves being the most common, though a few designed 
to target other races being more rare, but still present.</p>
