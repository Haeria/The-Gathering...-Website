					  <h2>Nightkin</h2>
      <p>
Nightkin are forged from the dark, cold expanse of space, that space 
between stars where light struggles to reach.  Their hair can range any 
color, from whites to blacks to varying hues all in one.  Their skin is any 
shade, so long as it is pale.  Their eyes trend toward cold, icy colors, or 
darker hues like blacks and greys.  Green and other colors are rare, but 
still occur.  Legend says that when a nightkin dies, his spirit departs the 
earthly remains in the form of a visible shadow.  Nightkin are primarily 
nocturnal creatures, and most of their worshipping and group rituals happen 
under the light of the moons.  When a Nightkin is born, their eyes are 
closed until they are lifted into the night sky and bathed in the darkness 
that is their domain.  Much like their Starkin cousins, the Nightkin do not 
have wings until puberty.  A faint tattoo of a pair of wings will grow and 
change as they age, revealing hints at what their wings will resemble when 
they finally appear.
		    </p><p>
When the Nightkin chooses to do so, they can make their wings vanish.  When 
the wings are hidden, the starburst mark on the wings, as well as the 
varying colors of the wings themselves, are transferred to the person's back 
as a tattoo. This vanishes, of course, when the wings are summoned again.

  <p> Star Kin are born of fire and the electricity of nebula. Their hair can 
    range from pure white to orange and yellow, never black. Their hair crackles 
    with sparks and their eyes, which may be almost every color, always hold 
    pinpricks of white fire. They are the creatures of the light in the night 
    sky.</p>

		<h2>Sekhym</h2>

<p>
The Sekhym Elves are an offshoot of the Sylvan Elves common to Tirradyn.  
They are not a new people to Tirradyn, but they are secretive.  Decades of 
negligence by the former Goddess of Magic led to them retreating into the 
deep, dark and wild places of Tirradyn, often eschewing large cities and the 
company of their elven cousins.  Despite being solitary, they are a friendly 
people, willing to go out of their way to help a stranger in need.  They are 
the self-proclaimed guardians of the leylines, the mortal lorekeepers of 
magic, rumored to include knowledge lost to the mortal races long ago.  With 
the ascension of a new God of Magic, one that seems to treasure the Art, as 
well as troubling portents seen among the stars, they have begun to make an 
appearance again on Tirradyn, with a select few venturing out from their 
	secluded homes to understand the new world they find themselves in. </p>

	<h2>Voidkin</h2>

<p>
The Voidkin are twisted versions of Nightkin and Starkin, 'cursed' in a way 
by the Jade Order of Rethia. The Voidkin are misfits.  Outcasts.  Even 
Arioch, which harbors all manner of folk without judgment, looks upon them 
with suspicion.  They are a creation of the Jade, and it is difficult for 
any of Rethian blood to trust them without reservation.  They are not evil, 
	but are considered 'darker' than their Starkin and Nightkin cousins.</p>
