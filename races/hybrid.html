     <h1>Hybrid</h1>

<h2>Avian</h2>
			  <p>Avians are the only airborne hybrid of man and beast: every Avian has a 
fully grown set of wings that allows them to move across the skies with 
little strain or effort. Avians usually have feathers covering most of their 
body and, when applicable, tails, though some breeds of Avian are less 
"pure" than others and may lack some of these details. For this same reason 
some Avians have beaks and more angular faces while others’ faces are more 
humanoid. They differ from their bird heritage in size, being closer to the 
size of humans, albeit usually a touch shorter, and in their limbs, as they 
have arms in addition to legs and wings. Avians come in all colors and 
patterns, depending on what sort of bird they most resemble, and they live 
in tightly knit groups in mountain aeries, communicating with one another in 
their own musical language that seems very confusing to those not born into 
it. The Faeries of Tirradyn and Avians tend to get along with one another 
slightly better than with other races if for no other reason than their 
mutual respect for nature and the similarities in their respective 
languages, allowing for easier communication between the two races.</p>
<h2>Cinsiyet</h2>
			  <p>Cinsiyets are truly an out of this world race, they birthplace is none other 
then Tirradyn’s moon Sazaa. Its unknown how they’ve made it from the watery 
moon down to the Tirradyn, but myth and legion suggest they’ve been visiting 
for a long time. Often called the Angels of the Sea, Cinsiyets are almost 
always polite and friendly, even forgiving to a fault. While its true they 
live in water, their fragile skin is unable to handle the harsh seawater of 
Tirradyn’s oceans. Most Cinsiyets have long hair, usually in different 
shades of green or blue or a mix of the two. Their eye colors know no limits 
and can be any color of the rainbow. Their toes and fingers have webbing 
they can expand while in the water to allow them to swim better, but that 
they can lower away while on the land to protect the thin membranes. From 
swimming so much, its rare to see an out of shape Cinsiyet, and while 
they’re home is under the fresh clean waters of Sazaa they have no problems 
taking to a life on land. They speak a beautifull language that some may 
consider to be quite musical and ethereal.</p>
<h2>Draconian</h2>
			  <p>Draconians are a proud race of dragon-like humanoids. Their key defining 
features are their leathery scales, sharp claws, and webbed wings, though 
there is a lot more to them than that. Draconians come from a rare paring of 
human and dragon many generations ago, and because of that, share 
characteristics between the two. Although most Draconians share the same 
aspects, depending on how close their ancestry is to their Dragon forefather 
they may be more human like or more dragon related. Like humans, Draconians 
are bipedal and posture-wise tend to stand straight, preferring their full 
height to slouching in almost all situations. No matter what, Draconians are 
always covered in leathery, armor-like scales that come in a variety of 
colors. The most common are red, black, green, white, and blue, although 
they do rarely come in more metallic gold, bronze, and rarely silver. 
Draconians with strange magical heritage have been known to have wilder 
colors such as pink or purple, although these are often rare and 
one-of-a-kind. They also all sport dangerous claws which are sharp enough to 
be used as weapons, but do not reduce the dexterity of their fingers.</p>
<h2>Equis</h2>
			  <p>Equis are a race of human-horse hybrids similar in form to minotaurs and 
Mrem, with regard to the general amalgam of characteristics. The range of 
equine characteristics in a given Equis varies in each individual. Most 
appear mainly human in body with heads more akin to horses, including a mane 
and long face with large eyes, lips, and flat teeth. Some have hooves 
instead of hands or feet. All have long flowing tails. Hair and hide 
coloration varies from white to black to brown to red, plain, striped, 
spotted, patchy, or a mess of any of the above. A populated Equis territory 
contains a menagerie of shapes, styles, and colors in its inhabitants' 
hides. The grounds inhabited by Equis are referred to as their territories 
as structures are largely nonexistent among their kind: they live in the 
open wherever possible and range freely across a vast spread of land over 
the course of a year's seasonal shifts. Though Equis rarely own their 
territories in any official sense, few have either the energy or inclination 
to try to force them out of the lands once an Equis family has taken up 
residence.</p>
<h2>Jalachara</h2>
			  <p>Jalachara are similar to Mrem and rawulf and all the other hybrid races, a 
biped form with animalistic features, in this case those of a lizard. Unlike 
Lizardmen(women) they are much less savage and their scales are smaller, 
still larger and thicker then skin but much more flexible and soft. It is 
because of their smaller scales that the Jalachara have moved from living 
mostly in swamps and marshlands to settle rain forest and jungles. The 
scales on a Jalachara need to stay moist or they'll crack and bleed, which 
keeps the Jalachara living close to water or in very wet environments. They 
are typically more savage then mrem or rawulf, omnivores with a preference 
for meat, semi-aquatic in nature with cold blood. They thrive on scavenging, 
pillaging and, in less hostile times, fishing and gathering, and hunting 
less-than-sentient races, it is not unheard of for Jalachara to farm both 
plants and animals when given the land to do so.</p>
<h2>Kitven</h2>
			  <p>One of the amalgam races, the Kitven (called Ratlings by some) are humanoids 
that possess the traits of rodents, specifically rats or mice. Thin and 
lanky, they possess a quickness and agility seen by very few other races. 
Like their animal cousins, they also possess thin fur over their bodies, and 
beady eyes. Their ears vary depending on the specific Kitven, some with 
large ears like mice, others smaller. They all have feet and hands with 
sharp, if short, claws. </p>
<h2>Merfolk</h2>
			  <p>A majestic, beautiful race, the merfolk hold themselves in high regard, 
but are not above shunning their own should a fellow merperson exhibit evil 
tendencies. Those who fall to darkness are exiled from the seas. Due to the fact that nearly any merperson a land-dwelling person encounters is likely to encounter is experiencing the world during their 
Calling, perceptions of the race tend to be that of the precocious, exceptionally curious phase. It's not uncommon for merfolk to take a newfound friend under the water and drown them, having forgotten that 
land-walkers cannot breathe without air.</p>
<h2>Mrem</h2>
			  <p>The Mrem are a bipedal feline race they have an almost humanoid frame, 
similar in height and stature to the average human, but their other major 
characteristics are more cat-like than human. They bear long, soft, furred 
tails which they often conceal under their clothing when wearing any, and 
their ears are triangular, giving them an impressive hearing range but 
doubling as a vulnerability to loud or sharp noises. Slit-pupils are 
centered in their feline eyes, eyes that allow them to see exceptionally 
well in low-light conditions, and a sensitive nose provides them with a 
superhuman sense of smell. They are agile creatures with lightning quick 
reflexes, as one might expect from a race of cats. Mrem speak in a language 
known simply as Mremish their young are known as kits, but little else is 
commonly shared from their culture with those considered outsiders. It is 
known that they are taught from an early age to hate and fear reptiles by 
the elder generations, and apparently a similar dislike is taught to kits 
with regard to the Vesrine, as these two races never seem to get along, but 
then that may simply be instinctual. While some Mrem have been known to 
experience a cyclic mating urge, "heat", its timing is inconsistent and not 
all members of their race seem to be afflicted by this trait it may be 
little more than another Human myth.</p>
<h2>Rawulf</h2>
			  <p>Often confused for werewolves, Rawulves are humanoids with the 
characteristics of canines. Ranging between six and seven feet in height and 
betweeen two hundred twenty to six hundred pounds in weight, Rawulves are 
often tall, muscular, and generally intimidating for smaller races. Most 
commonly displaying the characteristics of wolves or hyenas, Rawulves 
looking like other canines aren't unheard of. All Rawulves have tails, 
canine teeth, and sharp claws, as well as a thick pelt of fur around their 
bodies that protects them from even the harshest cold.  Their facial 
features are also canine-like, having snouts, canine noses, and large ears.</p>
<h2>Ursa</h2>
			  <p>Few could mistake, or miss, the sight of an Ursa. Standing between seven and 
eight feet in height and weighing between three to seven hundred pounds, 
this race of bear-men are quite easy to spot. The Ursa are a race of 
humanoids that possesses the traits of bears. Bear-like features are 
dominant on their faces, featuring a snout, bear-like ears, and a rather 
sharp set of teeth. Fur covers the entire body, usually white, brown, or 
black, though reddish-brown hues are not uncommon. Powerful claws are also 
present on the hands and feet, combined with a great strength making even an 
unarmed Ursa a deadly opponent. </p>
<h2>Vesrine</h2>
			  <p>Vesrine are often considered smaller cousins of humans. Their height to the 
tops of their head average around 3 ½ feet and range from the short 3 foot 
to the tall 4 ½ feet. 5-foot tall vesrine are very rare. They have a very 
similar build, limbs, digits except for a few features. Vesrine are 
Digitigrade, walking on their toes as opposed to flat footed, and have great 
leaping capabilities. An average vesrine can jump their own height and while 
sprinting tends to leap instead of run, as they can cover long distances in 
a single bound. The race also tends to have a ranging amount of fur 
depending on their family’s home continent. In sandy hot areas like near the 
Desert of Lost Dreams on Tu-Lips, vesrine may only have fur on their ears, 
tail, and extremities, while more cold areas like the snow fields of 
Elzothis may be covered with thick, shaggy fur.</p>
<h2>Tasellu (Player Made?)</h2>
			  <p>Though glimpses of them have been occasionally reported by trappers and 
rangers through the years, the Tasellu race was long thought to be a myth.  
This race of simian hybrids, though, have recently made themselves known, 
slipping out of their jungle hideaways for reasons known only to them.  
Ranging in size from four feet to nearly seven, they seem to have a range of 
types from baboons to chimpanzees, to gorillas, and everything in between.  
Being bipedal hybrids, much like the others of the realm, their features 
take on differing aspects of both humanoid and simian characteristics.  Fur 
and tails are usually present in some form, save the tailless apes.  
Coloring seems to vary widely as well, though only to shades helpful in 
hiding in nature.  They are a close-knit society, but seem somewhat 
hierarchical with certain species seeming to rank over others.  They are 
wary of other races, but are open and friendly enough.</p>
<h2>Felindred&nbsp;(Player Made?)</h2>
<p> The Fierlan are long-time residents of a secret kingdom hidden far away 
from prying eyes. Like the Faedra the Fierlan have also adapted to a 
lifestyle in the clouds, though they spend long amounts of time in gardens, 
holed up in temples, or sequestered in arcane towers. They are Faedra that 
have given themselves to the mana almost entirely, transforming their bodies 
into vessels capable of wielding great mana.</p>
			  
<h2>Faedra&nbsp;(Player Made?)</h2> 
<p>The Faedra are long-time residents of a secret kingdom hidden far away from 
prying eyes along with another race called the Fierlan, the Faedra adapted 
to a lifestyle in the clouds. They are the main transport of the cloud 
kingdom. They carry building materials and various other things to and fro, 
as well as others on occasion. The secondary form of a Faedra grows with 
age, the oldest growing large enough to transport many people. The oldest 
living Faedra recorded was around 650 years old when they passed away, 
resulting in a body length of twenty seven feet.</p>
