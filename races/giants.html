			  <h1>Giants</h1>
			  <h2>Cyclops*</h2>
			  <p>No info for this one yet.</p>
			  <h2>Fire-giant</h2>
			  <p>Fire-giants make their home within the furnaces of the world.  Living near,
in, and around volcanos and pools of magma has toughened their already tough
skin against the ravages of heat and flame and given, in most cases, a skin
tone of dark reddish brown.  They are, as all giants tend to be, heavily
muscled, however fire giants take this to new heights, often spending their
time in deep forges taking advantage of the heat they live in by hammering
away to create masterful works of armor and weaponry.  Though they tend to
stay clear of large cities, and other races, they enjoy the company of other
giants, and often gather in numbers to celebrate, tell stories, or just enjoy
occasional comradery.  They are known to sell their wares, sometimes camping
near towns and cities to do so, though they rarely wander in unless short on
supplies, or to visit friends. 
			  </p>
<h2>Half-giant</h2>
			  <p>Half-giants are born when giants mate with one of the many races they are
compatible with.  Though they can be born of a female giant mating with
males of other races, or to females of other races who have mated with a giant
male, the babies are usually so large that they often kill non-giant females
in childbirth, if not during the pregnancy.  Their physical characteristics
tend to be a blend of their two races, and their full height, generally
attained by the age of 25, is half-way between the two parents somewhere
between 7.5 to 9 feet tall.  They are generally ostracized by most giant
communities as half-breeds, though if the giant parent is well-liked, such
things are generally left unsaid and the child is at least partially
accepted.
			  </p>
<h2>Ice-giant</h2>
			  <p>Ice-giants inhabit the colder regions of the world, prefering ice and snow
to field and forest, and as such have built up high resistances to it.  They
are generally the same size as other giants, between 9 to 11 feet tall, but
they tend to have much more body and facial hair, one assumes as a genetic
defense against bitter cold winds.  They tend to be nomadic, traveling the
tundras in small groups, following the game that they hunt for food and hides.
They are a hardy folk, and are friendlier to outsiders much more so than the
other giant races.  The only time they leave their snowy wastelands is to
mingle in the large cities of the world selling furs, leather hides, and
other supplies that they make from those they hunt.  If one is traveling
through snowy lands, there is no better guide to have.
			  </p>
<h2>Mountain-giant</h2>
			  <p>Mountain-giants are the most rarely seen race of giants, usually only seen 
if one travels the mountain ranges where they make their homes.  They rarely 
come down to mingle with others, but younger mountain giants wandering the 
world is not unheard of, as their isolation tends to make young adults 
curious about the outside world.  They are the largest of giants, sometimes 
towering as high as 15 feet, and are very strong from all of the arduous 
climbing that they do.  They, like ice-giants, are resistant to the cold due 
to the often freezing temperatures in the higher mountains.  Their homes 
tend to be large caves hewn straight into mountain sides, though so much 
thought and skill goes into the hewing that those caves are very much like a 
home simply built from well-carved stone.  Though they do not choose to 
visit places outside of their mountains, they do not shun those that travel 
through their lands, and are willing to even help those that need supplies 
or guidance. 
			  </p>
<h2>Voadkyn</h2>
			  <p>Voadkyn, also called Wood Giants, are among the smallest of the giant-kin, 
standing only nine and a half feet tall on average with a weight of roughly 
seven hundred pounds. The have the same physical proportions as humans, 
giving them a thinner, lighter look than other Giants, but their facial 
features are more Elven than Human, giving them the appearance of 
giant-sized wood elves. They often refuse footwear, though they do wrap 
their ankles in strips of leather for support and protection. Voadkyn 
usually live in the same forests that Wood Elves favor, and the two races 
often co-exist, sharing a friendly bond with one another and the comforts 
nature provides in her forests that goes back to the time of the first 
legends, and likely existed even before these were written. Voadkyn do not 
have their own language, preferring to share the Elvesâ€™ own the way that 
they share their homes with one another. Voadkyn are widely known for their 
surprising litheness in such large bodies, as well as their natural 
intuitive ability.
