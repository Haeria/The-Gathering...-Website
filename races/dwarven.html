<h1>Dwarven</h1>
<h2>Duergar</h2>
			  <p>The Duergar are more commonly known as Grey Dwarves, a malevolent breed of 
Dwarf that is most often found at extreme depths beneath the earth. They 
prefer drap clothing designed to act as subtle camouflage, blending in with 
their rough underground homes, as though the darkness were not enough to 
hide them. Duergar society is very harsh because of the hostile environment 
in which they are usually found in these steaming depths, the strong are 
truly the only ones who can survive. They are more intelligent and dexterous 
than their Dwarf cousins, but usually weaker and less hardy, much the way 
that the Drow are weaker than their Elven kin, though Duergar are typically 
a bit larger than Dwarves, if only by a few inches. They speak the Dwarven 
language, but they do not at all enjoy the company of dwarves, and the two 
races usually attack one another on sight. </p>
<h2>Dwarf</h2>
			  <p>Dwarves are the tallest of the "miniature" races, but this does not by any 
means make them tall. They are stocky fellows easily identified by their 
diminutive size, wide and muscular build, and their abundant facial hair of 
which they are very proud, often braiding their wiry beards into intricate 
patterns before work or battle. They are known for their strength and 
courage, if not particularly for their intelligence, as well as their 
insatiable appetites for beer, ale, mead and stronger drink. Dwarves like 
the earth and dislike the sea, the latter no doubt due in part to their 
stubby limbs being unsuited to swimming. They are not overly fond of elves 
and have a fierce hatred of orcs and goblins, attacking the latter two as 
well as their own Duergar cousins on sight much of the time. Dwarves 
typically dwell in hilly or mountainous regions where caves are plentiful. 
Though not very charismatic according to the judgment of non-dwarf races, 
and not particularly swift, dwarves have an awesome endurance that makes 
them very difficult to keep down in a fight.</p>
<h2>Halfling</h2>
			  <p>Halflings, much as their name implies, are small humanoids, generally two to 
four feet in height and ranging between forty to a hundred pounds. Halflings 
to have rather plump bodies, with dark, curly hair atop their heads and 
feet. Their feet are also disproportionately large, making them dislike 
shoes, though they don't need them thanks to the thick soles on the bottoms 
of their feet. Halfling eye colors have the same range that Humans do, and 
they are naturally agile and rarely make a sound when they walk. </p>
