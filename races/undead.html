<h2>Banshee*</h2>
			  			  <p>When a soul passes on heavy with guilt or burning for revenge, it may return 
to the mortal plane as a tormented phantasm known as a Banshee. Forever 
locked in shadows and despair they creep through Tirradyn seeking out that 
which causes their eternal unrest, a killer perhaps or a task left 
unfinished before death, so that they may hopefully pass on to a peaceful 
rest guilt-free. As more and more Banshees appear and fail to find their 
rest, they have come to be recognized as a "race" in Tirradyn, as they do 
not appear to be going away any time soon. They tend to live close to their 
demon cousins or among the dead, often enjoying a power they never knew in 
life, but rarely enjoying this newfound strength with any true jubilation. 
Their horrendous wail can send the bravest warrior cowering in fear, or even 
strip his mind of sanity with the weight of countless years of unrelenting 
despair. </p>

<h2>Dhampiel</h2>
<p>Of all the races in Tirradyn known openly as killers, Dhampiels are perhaps 
the most respected and feared. These are the progeny of humans and vampires, 
creatures neither truly alive or dead, though not undead either, a race 
caught in limbo between these states. Their bodies age to a certain point, 
generally into late puberty or their early twenties, and stop there, never 
adding another wrinkle. Known as "daywalkers" by their vampiric kin, 
Dhampiels are unaffected by sunlight, unlike Vampires, and are free to move 
and exercise their full powers during the day. They also lack the fearsome 
hunger for blood that haunts their vampire relations, but that hunger does 
exist within them it is simply quieter than in vampires, more easily ignored 
when temptation rises. Dhampiels are capable of eating solid foods and 
drinking fluids other than blood in addition to sating their hunger for that 
liquid life force, allowing them to blend in with human company more easily 
than a Vampire might, a talent often aided by the fact that most Dhampiels 
look perfectly human, letting them walk among the cattle, so to speak, until 
they must find their next meal. To date, the only recorded Dhampiels have 
been as described above, but a few alchemists have theorized that a similar 
creature may be spawned were a vampire ever to couple with something other 
than a human.</p>

<h2>Revenant</h2>
<p>A revenant is an undead being created when the moment of death is so traumatic
that it separates a person's life energy from their body very shockingly and
suddenly.  This life energy, composed mostly of the being's shadow energy
with a bit of what's left of the soul, is what primarily makes up the revenant's
form.  However, revenants are able to, with the expenditure of energy and effort,
able to create a solid form of itself appearing as it did in real life.  Only
those skilled in the knowledge of the undead could ever know the true nature
of a revenant.  Dissipating the corporeal body also takes some effort, however
much less than forming it, and it often leaves behind a small puddle of dark
sludge.  It should be noted that even revenants who have formed a corporeal body
will cast no shadow, and they often stand in or near shadows to mask this fact
from the world.</p>
