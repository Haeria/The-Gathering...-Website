<h2>Brownie</h2>
			  			  <p>Brownies appear as tiny bipedal beings that look surprisingly like small
elves with a greenish tint to their skin.  Rarely growing taller than around
a foot and a half, their hair and eye colors are usually earth tones in
browns and greens.  They are elusive creatures in the wild, choosing to live
in places untainted by the touch of civilization and often hiding when others
approach.  Occasionally brownies will leave their homes and mingle with
society, though whether they leave voluntarily or not is unknown.  Little is
known of their society either, however some reports indicate that it is
quite tribal, with brownie clusters being led by an elder, usually the eldest
of the brownies in that cluster.  They typically enjoy bright colors, and
their clothing reflects this, though it's a mystery how they manage to 
disappear into the forests with such bright attire.</p>

<h2>Faerie</h2>
			  			  <p>Faeries tend to be a mischievous people found predominantly in sylvan 
settings, living in harmony with nature and often tormenting uninvited 
visitors.  Faeries speak their own tongue, a musical language more akin to 
singing than speech.  It is a rarity to find an outsider with any degree of 
fluency in this melodic language.  </p>

<h2>Goblin</h2>
			  			  <p>Goblins are sometimes thought to be failed imps, hellish creatures thrown 
out of the inferno for being too small, too weak, too dull to survive in the 
flames of eternal damnation, but generally they aren’t even given that much 
credit. They’re small humanoids, four feet tall on average and under one 
hundred pounds, with flat faces, broad noses, pointed ears, and wide mouths 
with small, almost dainty, sharp fangs. The dull, glazed eyes of goblins 
range from bright red to putrid green to electric yellow, the latter being 
closest to matching their speech, which is usually high-pitched and harsh, 
voices designed for squabbling and infighting. Goblins prefer to live in 
dark caves and other underground havens, generally collecting into tribes 
with specific pecking orders in which every member knows his or her place, 
similar to the mentality of a wolf pack. Ascension within the pack is 
achieved through battle and goblins constantly fight with one another to 
improve their rank. Tribes of goblins take slaves for food and labor 
whenever possible, and these are constantly kept under guard, if not 
shackled. Rescued prisoners consistently recite horrors of watching their 
fellow captives being beaten, raped and consumed, and some are themselves 
recovered with fewer limbs than they had had before being captured. </p>

<h2>Half-orc</h2>
			  			  <p>Bearing the traits of both Humans and Orcs, Half-orcs can sometimes pass as 
one or the other, though are usually very obviously a combination of the 
two. They tend to be a few inches shorter than their Orcish parent, bearing 
the same broad shoulders and heavily-muscled build, though to a lesser 
extreme. Half-orcs tend to vary quite a bit due to their human heritage, but 
males are generally are more hairy than most Humans. Their ears almost 
always are at least somewhat pointed, and their teeth sharper than what 
would be considered normal. Males also quite often develop side-burns, but 
rarely gain a full beard.</p>

<h2>Orc</h2>
			  			  <p>The warrior-race of orcs is built for strength and combat. Ranging between 
six and seven feet in height and weighing from two hundred to a massive six 
hundred points of thick muscle, they are an intimidating sight for most 
races. Orcs tend to have long, pointed ears much like those of Elves. Their 
hair ranges across the human spectrum (with browns and reds more common than 
blondes), as well as a few shades of green. Similarly, their eyes range the 
entire human spectrum, as well as including red. Orcish males tend to be 
hairy, particularly their chests, arms, and legs. Strangely, this hairiness 
doesn't extend to facial hair. While Orcish males can easily grow goatees 
and side-burns, they rarely connect to a full beard, and it's nearly 
impossible for such facial hair to grow very long. Regardless, Orcs have 
usually tan skin, though darker shades aren't unknown in certain tribes, and 
Orcish teeth are sharp much like those found on canines. </p>

<h2>Troll</h2>
			  			  <p>In a way, Trolls could be described as the twisted image of the Ursa. They 
have the size, the strength, the bulk and the communal mindset, and they 
carry as much hatred for life as the Ursa carry protective love of it. It is 
said that all things in nature require an opposite, a balance, and these 
must be the balance for those benevolent guardians of the forests. Little is 
known about these carnivorous destroyers, and most would rather it stayed 
that way. No one in reported history has ever been able to maintain a 
relationship of any kind with a Troll for more than a few days, as they 
never keep prisoners much longer than that even for entertainment. To the 
Trolls, pets are simply well-preserved meat. They are adaptable to the 
environment as needed, capable of living in nearly any climate, though few 
have ever been noted as thriving in desert conditions. The reason for this 
is unclear, but it is thought that trolls have some amphibious relation, 
making some form of moisture a necessity, or at least a comfort. This idea 
meshes with their physical characteristics, aside from the size and muscle 
mass, which include a rubbery, almost frog-like hide that ranges from sickly 
yellow to mottled green to midnight black. Trolls lack any sense of honor or 
morality without an outside influence bestowing such knowledge upon them, a 
rare occurrence, but have managed to cobble together their own guttural 
language, mostly from Human and Orcish sources with a few other tongues 
thrown in for flavor one of the first lessons Elvish rangers are taught is 
to listen for these baritone growls and brass-throated calls through the 
forest at night and to go in the other direction with all possible haste.</p>
