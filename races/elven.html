<h2>Drow</h2>
			  <p>Drow are the dark mirrors of Elves, more so than even Trolls are to the 
Ursa. Drow are nearly identical to Wood Elves in every physical respect, 
save that Drow are slightly weaker and smaller than Elves, and the skin of a 
Drow is the black of nights after the stars have all died. Their eyes are 
generally deep red, violet or black, and their hair only grows on the grey 
scale, most often seen in white or varying shades of grey. Black hair is 
rarely seen on a Drow, though according to myth it was once their only 
color, in the times when they were warriors supreme. Most give these myths 
little credit, believing them to be nothing more than Drow lies to try and 
build some legend of past power they never had. These skeptics are sometimes 
shaken by the revelation that those dark-haired Drow that do exist are often 
superior killers, but this is eventually named nothing more than 
coincidence. Drow are a subterranean race, living in caverns beneath the 
earth, and their vision in the dark is second to none. Drow are faster than 
humans and more agile, though their dexterity cannot outmatch that of Elves. 
Their society is matriarchal, with females heading each family and standing 
as the high priestesses to all the gods. Males are typically trained as 
warriors and mages, though many turn to thievery when they fail in their 
apprenticeships. </p>
<h2>Elf</h2>
			  <p>All Elves tend to be shorter and slimmer than humans, ranging from five to 
six feet in height and weighing roughly between eighty to one hundred and 
twenty pounds.  Alluring features that are delicate and refined, seemed 
sculpted at times with smooth cheekbones, small lips, elliptical eyes and 
efficient noses, in addition to their trademark tipped ears.  Hypnotically 
serene eyes come in all manner of colors: lavender, ice-blue, clover and 
jade, periwinkle, all the shades of the good earth, all the streams of the 
rainbow, all the tones of the night sky, from the marble white of passing 
clouds to the absolute darkness of a moonless, starless midnight.  Their 
hair colors tend to mingle in range within most normal tones and 
hightlights.</p>
<h2>Half-elf</h2>
<p>Human traits rarely seem to come out on top when mixed with more mystical 
blood, as is evident in both Half-orcs and Half-elves. In the case of 
Half-elves, though, this mixture is quite beneficial, granting them both the 
strength and hardiness of humans, or close to it, and the handsome, or 
beautiful, features associated with elves, along with their agility, 
dexterity, and affinity with nature. They mingle relatively well with 
humans, but are not always well accepted by their elven kin, who have been 
known to consider such half-bloods abominations, mostly dependant upon which 
side of the coupling was elven, and whom the parents were according to 
class. Still, their exclusion from either side of the racial pool is nowhere 
near so extreme as it typically is for Half-orcs. They are slightly taller 
than most elves, and heavier, and as they are more freely brought into human 
communities they typically speak human tongues and follow their trade sense, 
rather than Elvesâ€™.</p>
<h2>High-elf</h2>
<p>High elves consider themselves to be the purest of all the elven races, their
pride besting even that of the proudest drow.  Because of this, they are
often thought of by other elves as being unbearably haughty.  They tend to
take this pride in their purity to such extremes that one of their numbers
caught dallying with a lower race is often punished harshly.  High-elf females
that give birth to half-breeds are exiled entirely from the society, often
after a severe whipping.  In some cases, the half-breed child is killed to
prevent high-elf blood from mixing with that of the lower races when it grows
to an adult.  While they see the other elven races as impure, the double this
opinion of the drow, often seeing them as the lowest of the low, and there is
a hatred between the high-elves and the drow that often erupts into skirmishes
and at times minor wars.  Because of their racial purity, the features of
high-elves are more pronounced.  Their ears are longer somewhat, their limbs
more lithe and agile, and their facial features more elven in appearance.
Most all of them have lightly colored hair, white to yellow-gold.  Their eyes
are almost always blue or green, though the occasional golden-eyed high-elf is
born.</p>
<h2>Moon-elf</h2>
<p>Moon-Elves come in two varieties, those who were born upon the moons of
Tirradyn, and those that choose to dwell in the moonlight that covers the
world at night.  Some speculate that the latter revere the moons so much
because at some point in their history, their ancestors dwelt upon them, but
moon-elves are notorious for living in the moment and tending to ignore, and
thus not keep histories on, such things as ancestry and origin.  As they tend
to move about mostly at night when the moons are shining, they have very fair
complexions, and their hair color tends to be darker shades of brown and black,
though some lighter-haired moon-elves are occasionally born.  Their choice of
dwelling seems not to be very important to them, though their homes do tend to
be near open fields where the moons shine down unhindered by trees.  Some
communities choose living in the trees as their wood-elf cousins do, while
others choose to build small homes on the ground if there are no large trees
near the spot they have chosen to make home.  Being a spontaneous elven race,
they revel in the present, and their society reflects this, with leadership
of them being passed around seemingly at a whim to outsiders, and though it
does have a structure, the intricacies of it are lost on those of other
races.</p>
<h2>Shikigami-elf</h2>
<p>The Shikigami are an off-shoot of the Elven race, much like the Drow. This 
is obvious by their appearence, bearing lithe, graceful forms that is 
natural to the entire Elven race. Also like their High Elven cousins, the 
Shikigami Elves have long, pointed ears. They differ, however, in that their 
skin tends towards more bronzed complexions as opposed to the standard Elven 
fairness, and their hair favors shades of red and brown compared to standard 
Elven blonde. The Shikigami range between five to six feet in height and 
weigh between eighty and a hundred and fifty pounds. They never develop 
significant fat, but have been known to be able to hold more toned, muscular 
builds than their High Elven counterparts, though still not to the degree a 
Human could reach.</p>
<h2>Snow-elf</h2>
<p>Snow-elves have chosen to make their homes in the colder places of the world,
usually out of the snow and ice that make up the environment, often crafting
wondrous homes of ice crystals and solid blocks of frozen snow.  They have a
high resistance to cold, and warmer climes tend to make them somewhat sweaty
and uncomfortable, but if they spend enough time in warmer weather, they adapt
fairly well.  Their physical appearance tends to mirror their environment, 
leaning toward fair complexions and lighter colored hair.  It is said that if
one walks across a flat field of snow, you could walk past a dozen snow-elves
hiding against the white of it and never notice them.  Since they cannot farm,
they have become hunters through generations, often forming large hunting
parties to track large herds of beasts wandering the snowy lands, and are
known for utilizing trained timber wolves in their hunts.  Their leadership
is a well structured hierarchy with both men and women holding seats of power
among them.</p>
<h2>Sun-elf</h2>
<p>Sun-elves are the most mysterious of elven kin, and little is known about them
outside of their communities.  At times they seem to be tribal, and at others
a fine-tuned creation of democracy.  With their tanned skin, and their hair
of red to blonde colors, they are often mistaken for their shikigami cousins
at first, and while they do resemble them in appearance, they hold a little
more pride in what they are as a race.  They revere the sun, and bask in its
rays, often choosing climes where the sun shines most often without cloud
cover or rainy weather, sometimes even dwelling deep in the deserts where
clouds are scarcist.  They are the least agile of the elven races, though
they make up for it with some added strength and durability.  As a society
they are hunter-gatherers in most climates, as farms tend to require rainfall
which they dislike.  They have no dislike for outsiders, and will openly
interact with them if occasion arises, but they will not seek out such
interactions.</p>
<h2>Sylvan-elf</h2>
<p>Sylvan-elves are the more mystical kin of all the elven races, often excelling
in the magical arts be they druidic, clerical, or mage-like.  They make their
homes near to what they call 'magical ley lines', where magical powers are
said to be the strongest, and those dwellings depend on the environment, be
it within trees, fabricated homes, underground caverns, or anything in between.
Their appearance varies widely as well, with skin tones, hair color, and eye
color running the whole spectrum of possibilities.  One thing that most of
the sylven-elves have in common though, are their tattoos, usually of magical
runes or other mystical symbols and patterns, and some say that these markings
both increase their spellcasting abilities, and mark their places in the
hierarchy of society.  They are a mysterious race, often secretive about their
arts and culture, but they are welcoming of outsiders as long as those people
do not pry too deeply into their secrets.</p>
<h2>Water-elf</h2>
<p>Water-elves choose to dwell around as much water as possible.  Though they
prefer lakes and rivers, they have been known to dwell on oceanfronts as well.
They excel in diving and swimming, and their bodies have adapted to this over
generations, allowing them to hold their breath for very long periods of time.
Some have developed webbing between their fingers, though not all have, and
some are even said to possess gills, though whether this is true or not isn't
clear.  They are a fishing people, no matter the body of water they are near,
and lake-dwellers are well-known for their boat-making abilities, and for
sailing the lake's surface to fish deeper waters.  In appearance, they are
much like their wood-elf cousins, and those dwelling along riverbanks often
make homes in the trees along the banks.</p>
<h2>Wood-elf</h2>
<p>No helpfile.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<h2>Sekhym</h2>
<p>The Sekhym Elves are an offshoot of the Sylvan Elves common to Tirradyn.  
They are not a new people to Tirradyn, but they are secretive.  Decades of 
negligence by the former Goddess of Magic led to them retreating into the 
deep, dark and wild places of Tirradyn, often eschewing large cities and the 
company of their elven cousins.  Despite being solitary, they are a friendly 
people, willing to go out of their way to help a stranger in need.  They are 
the self-proclaimed guardians of the leylines, the mortal lorekeepers of 
magic, rumored to include knowledge lost to the mortal races long ago.  With 
the ascension of a new God of Magic, one that seems to treasure the Art, as 
well as troubling portents seen among the stars, they have begun to make an 
appearance again on Tirradyn, with a select few venturing out from their 
secluded homes to understand the new world they find themselves in.</p>
