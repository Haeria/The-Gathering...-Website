			  <h1>Special</h1>
<h2>Ambar</h2><p>The Ambar Nelath are bathed in the golden hue, covering their skin in a 
casting of rich brilliance, often with a glittery pearl sheen. Not elven and 
not angelic, the Nelath are a unique and incredible sight to behold. Their 
facial features often lean to elven or half-elven heritage, with the slender 
and shapely ears, beautiful and stately structure. Their physical build 
leans more to the strength of an avenging angel. The theory is that these 
beings are a tribute to the God known as the Amber Knight and the great 
Barbediel, or as some rumors suggest, their own creation to come into being 
at the time they did.</p>
			  
<h2>Darkling</h2><p>Darklings are perhaps the least understood race upon Tirradyn.  They are 
neither a natural race, nor a race specifically created by anyone.  Instead, 
they are a product of the consequences of misplaced magic and time.  It 
happens upon occasion that a person becomes trapped in the shadow world 
either through a malfunctioning magical portal, or in tampering with shadow 
magics. Over time, this person changes within the shadow world, losing their 
physical form and most, if not all, memories of their former life.  Their 
shape alters and eventually becomes nothing more than an ephemeral memory of 
what it once was.  Darklings in this form may escape from the shadow world, 
but must take on a form while in the material realm. The energy to do this 
is taxing, and darklings were once required to consume souls in order to 
maintain a form for very long, however Trellan devised a means of protecting 
the world from the hunger of the escaping darklings by binding their energy 
to his own, thereby giving them the ability to maintain their form while 
increasing his own strength, though the darklings need not serve him in any 
way. Darklings would consume these souls by killing their victim, then upon 
death, they absorb it from the dying/dead corpse.</p>
			  
<h2>Saurot</h2> <p> The theory is that these beings are a tribute to the Goddess Zranic and 
the Goddess Kasim, or as some rumors suggest, their own creation to come 
into being at the time they did. Silver skinned with faint blue, red, purple 
or black tinting. Saurots have slender forms generally and can reach heights 
of seven feet, resulting in lean and lanky appearances. Some of the Saurots 
can have a skeletal build to their form, while others can be quite curvy. 
Pasty skin is often (Not always) an attribute of the race and can be tacky 
to the touch, much like blood itself when freshly spilled. Some Saurots can 
appear perfectly healthy with no signs of illness, while others tend to lean 
toward sickly appearances, with no actual causes.</p>
