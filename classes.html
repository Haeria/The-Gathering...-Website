	<h3>Description</h3>
<p>Warriors live for combat and the thrill of battle. They are the best 
fighters of all the classes, but lack the subtle skills of thieves and the 
magical talents of mages and clerics.  Warriors are best for those who don't 
mind taking the direct approach, even when another method might be called 
	for.</p>
<p>Warriors begin with skill in the sword, and gain a second attack in combat. 
Other weapon skills may be purchased cheaply, or gained in the default skill 
package, which includes the following skills:<br/>
<strong>bash</strong> - a forceful rush with the body, designed to flatten your foes<br/>
<strong>enhanced damage</strong> - this skill multiplies your damage in battle<br/>
<strong>parry</strong> - the art of parrying with weapons<br/>
<strong>rescue</strong> - allows you to take the blows aimed for a companion<br/>
<strong>shield block</strong> - the art of parrying with a shield<br/>
<strong>disarm</strong> - used to deprive your opponent of his weapon<br/>
<strong>third attack</strong> - allows the skilled warrior to land three blows in one round<br/>
<strong>weaponsmaster</strong> - this group provides knowledge of all weapon types

	<h3>Description</h3><p>The mage class is reserved for those people that show significant abilities 
with channeling the various forms of energy which exist within the world of 
Tirradyn.  While other classes may be able to touch upon those energies in 
smaller and weaker ways, ma/ges excel in manipulating them, resulting in a 
wide array of spells. </p>
<p>As mages learn and grow in power, they tend to specialize in one form of 
magic or another, resulting in the various mage classes which exist.  In 
combat, mages do fairly well with daggers and such, however they excel with 
staves, and if they are lucky enough to find one, some staves are able to 
have energies channeled through them to help focus a mages casting abilities 
for better effect.  All of the mage classes have generally the same 
abilities in combat, since their focus is mainly on honing their magical 
abilities. Though mages certainly may be either good or evil, or anywhere in 
between, the mage classes themselves aren't aligned in this fashion, so 
you'll be just as likely to run into an evil enchanter as you would a good 
psionic.</p>
<p>As indicated, there are various elemental and ephemeral spheres of energy 
which a mage can draw upon. The different elemental energy spheres available 
are: <strong>Fire</strong>, <strong>Water</strong>, <strong>Earth</strong>, 
<strong>Air</strong>, <strong>Shadow</strong>, <strong>Soul</strong>, 
<strong>Death</strong>, and <strong>Void</strong>.  These are the 
only energies which may be channeled and manipulated by the normal mortals 
of Tirradyn.  Most mages can use any or all of these either alone, or in 
conjunction with each other, though some are more difficult to work with 
without specializing in such fields.  All mage spells use one or more of 
these energies to power them, and these spheres may be meditated upon to 
raise or lower them so that specialization is possible.</p>

			<h3>Description</h3>
<p>			Thieves are a marginal class. They do few things better than any other 
class, but have the widest range of skills available.  Thieves are 
specialists at thievery and covert actions, being capable of entering areas 
undetected where more powerful adventurers would fear to tread.  They are 
better fighters than clerics, but lack the wide weapon selection of 
warriors.</p>

<p>All thieves begin with the dagger combat skill, and are learned in steal as 
well.  Any other weapon skills must be purchased, unless the default 
selection is chosen.  This default skill package includes:<br/>
<strong>backstab</strong> - the art of attacking from the shadows<br/>
<strong>dagger</strong> - the weapon of choice for thieves, ideal for backstabbing<br/>
<strong>dodge</strong> - avoid blows in combat<br/>
<strong>hide</strong> - the art of remaining undetected in a room<br/>
<strong>mace</strong> - the use of maces and other blunt weapons<br/>
<strong>peek</strong> - used to look into a person's belongings<br/>
<strong>dirt kicking</strong> - skill of trickery to blind your victim with dirt<br/>
<strong>sneak</strong>- move undetected from room to room<br/>
<strong>steal</strong> - any thief is adept in retrieving objects<br/>
<strong>pick lock</strong> - a useful skill for breaking and entering<br/>
<strong>disarm </strong> - used to deprive your opponent of his weapon<br/>
<strong>second attack</strong> - with training, the skilled thief can hit twice as fast </p>

		<h3>Description</h3>
<p>		Clerics are people that have chosen to follow the path of enlightenment
through a deity.  Their powers are derived directly from this deity
for most things, though purely physical skills aren't.  Clerics have
mid-level combat abilities, excelling most with bludgeoning based weapons
such as maces and flails.  The deity a cleric chooses to follow may be
either good or evil.  Neutral clerics exist, but in some areas their
powers are diminished from those that have chosen a side.</p>
 
<p>Clerics are the most defensively orientated of all the classes.  Most of 
their spells focus on healing or defending the faithful, with their few 
combat spells being far less powerful than those of mages. However, clerics 
are the best class by far at healing magics, and they possess an impressive 
array of protective magics, as well as fair combat prowess.</p>
 
<p>Since they worship and derive their powers from a deity, clerics have an
additional stat that other classes do not:  piety.  A cleric's piety will
increase through prayer, making sacrifices to their deity, and through
the use of their powers.  As their piety rises, so does the power of
their spells.  Piety will slowly decrease over time without prayer, usage,
and sacrifice.</p>

	<h3>Description</h3>
<p>The ranger class is the base class for those characters that have an 
affinity to nature.  The ranger class itself has little magic to speak of, 
as those first beginning to commune with nature have not learned many of the 
powers that nature can provide, however this does not mean that this class 
is without its abilities.  Rangers are fairly decent fighters, falling 
between warriors and thieves in this respect, plus they receive combat 
bonuses when fighting in outdoor nature based sectors that make them nearly 
the equal of warriors in such situations.  Rangers also receive nature based 
skills such as building shelters and tree blinds, creating things from the 
natural surroundings, and the camouflage ability which renders a ranger 
entirely unseen except by those with special vision or other rangers of 
greater skill.  Rangers also learn the lore of herbs and plants, and are 
able to use them to mix a variety of beneficial remedies and concoctions 
that provide a host of benefits.  Rangers may use any weapon they wish, 
though longer weapons such as polearms will handicap them in close quarters. 
</p> 
<p>Rangers excel most with the spear and the sword, and receive several unique 
skills with the spear that no other classes can gain. Rangers can be of any 
alignment, though evil rangers don't idolize nature so much as they find it 
comforting or useful.  More often, evil rangers merely feel closer to nature 
because it provides them a safe sanctuary to hide in away from bustling 
cities full of guards, however this doesn't make them any less adept at the 
abilities afforded them through their connection to the natural world. </p>

<h3>Description</h3>
<p>Monks are spiritual warriors who have devoted their energy to the 
perfection, and balance, of mind, body, and spirit. To this end, the monks 
undergo a rigorous training regimen. Instead of using mana as a source of 
power, monks have turned inward, drawing upon the power of their spirit, to 
harness a new energy they know as Chi. Monks focus upon Order and Chaos, 
more than the sometimes subjective ideals of Good and Evil.  Though 
unwilling to use weapons, depending solely on the purity and strength of the 
body, their hands and feet become fearsome weapons of destruction, able to 
deal out damage and death easily and sometimes with little effort.  They 
have also achieved some little enlightenment, allowing them to use their chi 
energy to overcome and strengthen what might be considered weaknesses of the 
body. Monk prime stats are Strength and Dexterity.</p>

<h3>Description</h3>
			  
<p>The druid class is for those that see nature as something grander than 
civilization and all that it entails.  They love nature in all of its forms, 
from the budding of a tiny flower to the violence of a tiger taking down an 
antelope.  Often they choose to dwell only in nature, giving up the cities 
and towns of the world to live among that which they love.  This isn't to 
say that they give up on people entirely, after all people are a part of 
nature too, and when people encounter druids, the meetings are generally 
pleasant enough in most circumstances. In living in the wilds, though, 
druids have developed their own standard of magic to both use nature for 
their purposes, and to commune with it and help it to thrive and sometimes 
fight when it seems it will be overwhelmed otherwise.</p>  

<p>In combat, druids are not the most fearsome class one might come across, 
but they do hold their own even sometimes against greater odds.  They excel 
with both staff and spear, and occasionally daggers, though they tend to 
eschew unnaturally made weapons such as swords and the like.  Druids can 
hail from any alignment, since both good and evil alike can foster a love 
and appreciation for nature, they are however, most often neutral, as most 
things of nature are.  </p>

<p>Druids also often choose to create a grove, where they imprint themselves, 
and can thereafter draw upon the strength of the plants within the grove to 
aid them.  If they choose to imprint themselves on a grove, however, their 
power and in some cases even their lives are tied to the health of the 
grove, so such groves must be tended well lest their unhealthiness drag the 
druid down. </p>
